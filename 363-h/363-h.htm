                             [And only chapter ED.]</pre>
    <p>
      The house on the hill showed lights only upon the first floor&mdash;in the
      spacious reception hall, the dining room, and those more or less
      mysterious purlieus thereof from which emanate disagreeable odors and
      agreeable foods.
    </p>
    <p>
      From behind a low bush across the wide lawn a pair of eyes transferred to
      an alert brain these simple perceptions from which the brain deduced with
      Sherlockian accuracy and Raffleian purpose that the family of the
      president of The First National Bank of&mdash;Oh, let's call it Oakdale&mdash;was
      at dinner, that the servants were below stairs and the second floor
      deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the eyes had but recently descended from the quarters of the
      chauffeur above the garage which he had entered as a thief in the night
      and quitted apparelled in a perfectly good suit of clothes belonging to
      the gentlemanly chauffeur and a soft, checked cap which was now pulled
      well down over a pair of large brown eyes in which a rather strained
      expression might have suggested to an alienist a certain neophytism which
      even the stern set of well shaped lips could not effectually belie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently this was a youth steeling himself against a natural repugnance
      to the dangerous profession he had espoused; and when, a moment later, he
      stepped out into the moonlight and crossed the lawn toward the house, the
      slender, graceful lines which the ill-fitting clothes could not entirely
      conceal carried the conviction of youth if not of innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brazen assurance with which the lad crossed the lawn and mounted the
      steps to the verandah suggested a familiarity with the habits and customs
      of the inmates of the house upon the hill which bespoke long and careful
      study of the contemplated job. An old timer could not have moved with
      greater confidence. No detail seemed to have escaped his cunning
      calculation. Though the door leading from the verandah into the reception
      hall swung wide to the balmy airs of late Spring the prowler passed this
      blatant invitation to the hospitality of the House of Prim. It was as
      though he knew that from his place at the head of the table, with his back
      toward the great fire place which is the pride of the Prim dining hall,
      Jonas Prim commands a view of the major portion of the reception hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping low the youth passed along the verandah to a window of the
      darkened library&mdash;a French window which swung open without noise to
      his light touch. Stepping within he crossed the room to a door which
      opened at the foot of a narrow stairway&mdash;a convenient little stairway
      which had often let the Hon. Jonas Prim pass from his library to his
      second floor bed-room unnoticed when Mrs. Prim chanced to be entertaining
      the feminine elite of Oakdale across the hall. A convenient little
      stairway for retiring husbands and diffident burglars&mdash;yes, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness of the upper hallway offered no obstacle to this familiar
      housebreaker. He passed the tempting luxury of Mrs. Prim's boudoir, the
      chaste elegance of Jonas Prim's bed-room with all the possibilities of
      forgotten wallets and negotiable papers, setting his course straight for
      the apartments of Abigail Prim, the spinster daughter of the First
      National Bank of Oakdale. Or should we utilize a more charitable and at
      the same time more truthful word than spinster? I think we should, since
      Abigail was but nineteen and quite human, despite her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the dressing table of Abigail reposed much silver and gold and ivory,
      wrought by clever artisans into articles of great beauty and some utility;
      but with scarce a glance the burglar passed them by, directing his course
      straight across the room to a small wall safe cleverly hidden by a bit of
      tapestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, Oh how, this suggestive familiarity with the innermost secrets of a
      virgin's sacred apartments upon the part of one so obviously of the male
      persuasion and, by his all too apparent calling, a denizen of that
      underworld of which no Abigail should have intimate knowledge? Yet, truly
      and with scarce a faint indication of groping, though the room was dark,
      the marauder walked directly to the hidden safe, swung back the tapestry
      in its frame, turned the knob of the combination and in a moment opened
      the circular door of the strong box.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fat roll of bills and a handful of jewelry he transferred to the pockets
      of his coat. Some papers which his hand brushed within the safe he pushed
      aside as though preadvised of their inutility to one of his calling. Then
      he closed the safe door, closed the tapestry upon it and turned toward a
      dainty dressing table. From a drawer in this exquisite bit of Sheraton the
      burglar took a small, nickel plated automatic, which he slipped into an
      inside breast pocket of his coat, nor did he touch another article therein
      or thereon, nor hesitate an instant in the selection of the drawer to be
      rifled. His knowledge of the apartment of the daughter of the house of
      Prim was little short of uncanny. Doubtless the fellow was some plumber's
      apprentice who had made good use of an opportunity to study the lay of the
      land against a contemplated invasion of these holy precincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even the most expert of second story men nod and now that all seemed
      as though running on greased rails a careless elbow raked a silver
      candle-stick from the dressing table to the floor where it crashed with a
      resounding din that sent cold shivers up the youth's spine and conjured in
      his mind a sudden onslaught of investigators from the floor below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of the falling candlestick sounded to the taut nerved
      house-breaker as might the explosion of a stick of dynamite during prayer
      in a meeting house. That all Oakdale had heard it seemed quite possible,
      while that those below stairs were already turning questioning ears, and
      probably inquisitive footsteps, upward was almost a foregone conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjoining Miss Prim's boudoir was her bath and before the door leading
      from the one to the other was a cretonne covered screen behind which the
      burglar now concealed himself the while he listened in rigid apprehension
      for the approach of the enemy; but the only sound that came to him from
      the floor below was the deep laugh of Jonas Prim. A profound sigh of
      relief escaped the beardless lips; for that laugh assured the youth that,
      after all, the noise of the fallen candlestick had not alarmed the
      household.
    </p>
    <p>
      With knees that still trembled a bit he crossed the room and passed out
      into the hallway, descended the stairs, and stood again in the library.
      Here he paused a moment listening to the voices which came from the dining
      room. Mrs. Prim was speaking. &ldquo;I feel quite relieved about Abigail,&rdquo; she
      was saying. &ldquo;I believe that at last she sees the wisdom and the advantages
      of an alliance with Mr. Benham, and it was almost with enthusiasm that she
      left this morning to visit his sister. I am positive that a week or two of
      companionship with him will impress upon her the fine qualities of his
      nature. We are to be congratulated, Jonas, upon settling our daughter so
      advantageously both in the matter of family and wealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jonas Prim grunted. &ldquo;Sam Benham is old enough to be the girl's father,&rdquo; he
      growled. &ldquo;If she wants him, all right; but I can't imagine Abbie wanting a
      bald-headed husband with rheumatism. I wish you'd let her alone, Pudgy, to
      find her own mate in her own way&mdash;someone nearer her own age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child is not old enough to judge wisely for herself,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
      Prim. &ldquo;It was my duty to arrange a proper alliance; and, Jonas, I will
      thank you not to call me Pudgy&mdash;it is perfectly ridiculous for a
      woman of my age&mdash;and position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The burglar did not hear Mr. Prim's reply for he had moved across the
      library and passed out onto the verandah. Once again he crossed the lawn,
      taking advantage of the several trees and shrubs which dotted it, scaled
      the low stone wall at the side and was in the concealing shadows of the
      unlighted side street which bounds the Prim estate upon the south. The
      streets of Oakdale are flanked by imposing battalions of elm and maple
      which over-arch and meet above the thoroughfares; and now, following an
      early Spring, their foliage eclipsed the infrequent arclights to the
      eminent satisfaction of those nocturnal wayfarers who prefer neither
      publicity nor the spot light. Of such there are few within the well
      ordered precincts of law abiding Oakdale; but to-night there was at least
      one and this one was deeply grateful for the gloomy walks along which he
      hurried toward the limits of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he found himself upon a country road with the odors of Spring in
      his nostrils and the world before him. The night noises of the open
      country fell strangely upon his ears accentuating rather than relieving
      the myriad noted silence of Nature. Familiar sounds became unreal and
      weird, the deep bass of innumerable bull frogs took on an uncanny
      humanness which sent a half shudder through the slender frame. The burglar
      felt a sad loneliness creeping over him. He tried whistling in an effort
      to shake off the depressing effects of this seeming solitude through which
      he moved; but there remained with him still the hallucination that he
      moved alone through a strange, new world peopled by invisible and
      unfamiliar forms&mdash;menacing shapes which lurked in waiting behind each
      tree and shrub.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased his whistling and went warily upon the balls of his feet, lest
      he unnecessarily call attention to his presence. If the truth were to be
      told it would chronicle the fact that a very nervous and frightened
      burglar sneaked along the quiet and peaceful country road outside of
      Oakdale. A lonesome burglar, this, who so craved the companionship of man
      that he would almost have welcomed joyously the detaining hand of the law
      had it fallen upon him in the guise of a flesh and blood police officer
      from Oakdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In leaving the city the youth had given little thought to the
      practicalities of the open road. He had thought, rather vaguely, of
      sleeping in a bed of new clover in some hospitable fence corner; but the
      fence corners looked very dark and the wide expanse of fields beyond
      suggested a mysterious country which might be peopled by almost anything
      but human beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a farm house the youth hesitated and was almost upon the verge of
      entering and asking for a night's lodging when a savage voiced dog
      shattered the peace of the universe and sent the burglar along the road at
      a rapid run.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half mile further on a straw stack loomed large within a fenced
      enclosure. The youth wormed his way between the barbed wires determined at
      last to let nothing prevent him from making a cozy bed in the deep straw
      beside the stack. With courage radiating from every pore he strode toward
      the stack. His walk was almost a swagger, for thus does youth dissemble
      the bravery it yearns for but does not possess. He almost whistled again;
      but not quite, since it seemed an unnecessary provocation to disaster to
      call particular attention to himself at this time. An instant later he was
      extremely glad that he had refrained, for as he approached the stack a
      huge bulk slowly loomed from behind it; and silhouetted against the
      moonlit sky he saw the vast proportions of a great, shaggy bull. The
      burglar tore the inside of one trousers' leg and the back of his coat in
      his haste to pass through the barbed wire fence onto the open road. There
      he paused to mop the perspiration from his forehead, though the night was
      now far from warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      For another mile the now tired and discouraged house-breaker plodded,
      heavy footed, the unending road. Did vain compunction stir his youthful
      breast? Did he regret the safe respectability of the plumber's apprentice?
      Or, if he had not been a plumber's apprentice did he yearn to once again
      assume the unharried peace of whatever legitimate calling had been his
      before he bent his steps upon the broad boulevard of sin? We think he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he saw through the chinks and apertures in the half ruined wall
      of what had once been a hay barn the rosy flare of a genial light which
      appeared to announce in all but human terms that man, red blooded and
      hospitable, forgathered within. No growling dogs, no bulking bulls
      contested the short stretch of weed grown ground between the road and the
      disintegrating structure; and presently two wide, brown eyes were peering
      through a crack in the wall of the abandoned building. What they saw was a
      small fire built upon the earth floor in the center of the building and
      around the warming blaze the figures of six men. Some reclined at length
      upon old straw; others squatted, Turk fashion. All were smoking either
      disreputable pipes or rolled cigarets. Blear-eyed and foxy-eyed, bearded
      and stubbled cheeked, young and old, were the men the youth looked upon.
      All were more or less dishevelled and filthy; but they were human. They
      were not dogs, or bulls, or croaking frogs. The boy's heart went out to
      them. Something that was almost a sob rose in his throat, and then he
      turned the corner of the building and stood in the doorway, the light from
      the fire playing upon his lithe young figure clothed in its torn and ill
      fitting suit and upon his oval face and his laughing brown eyes. For
      several seconds he stood there looking at the men around the fire. None of
      them had noticed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tramps!&rdquo; thought the youth. &ldquo;Regular tramps.&rdquo; He wondered that they had
      not seen him, and then, clearing his throat, he said: &ldquo;Hello, tramps!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Six heads snapped up or around. Six pairs of eyes, blear or foxy, were
      riveted upon the boyish figure of the housebreaker. &ldquo;Wotinel!&rdquo; ejaculated
      a frowzy gentleman in a frock coat and golf cap. &ldquo;Wheredju blow from?&rdquo;
       inquired another. &ldquo;'Hello, tramps'!&rdquo; mimicked a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth came slowly toward the fire. &ldquo;I saw your fire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I
      thought I'd stop. I'm a tramp, too, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; sighed the elderly person in the frock coat. &ldquo;He's a tramp, he is.
      An' does he think gents like us has any time for tramps? An' where might
      he be trampin', sonny, without his maw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth flushed. &ldquo;Oh say!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;you needn't kid me just because
      I'm new at it. You all had to start sometime. I've always longed for the
      free life of a tramp; and if you'll let me go along with you for a little
      while, and teach me, I'll not bother you; and I'll do whatever you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elderly person frowned. &ldquo;Beat it, kid!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;We ain't
      runnin' no day nursery. These you see here is all the real thing. Maybe we
      asks fer a handout now and then; but that ain't our reg'lar way. You ain't
      swift enough to travel with this bunch, kid, so you'd better duck. Why we
      gents, here, if we was added up is wanted in about twenty-seven cities fer
      about everything from rollin' a souse to crackin' a box and croakin' a
      bull. You gotta do something before you can train wid gents like us, see?&rdquo;
       The speaker projected a stubbled jaw, scowled horridly and swept a
      flattened palm downward and backward at a right angle to a hairy arm in
      eloquent gesture of finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy had stood with his straight, black eyebrows puckered into a
      studious frown, drinking in every word. Now he straightened up. &ldquo;I guess I
      made a mistake,&rdquo; he said, apologetically. &ldquo;You ain't tramps at all. You're
      thieves and murderers and things like that.&rdquo; His eyes opened a bit wider
      and his voice sank to a whisper as the words passed his lips. &ldquo;But you
      haven't so much on me, at that,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;for I'm a regular burglar,
      too,&rdquo; and from the bulging pockets of his coat he drew two handfuls of
      greenbacks and jewelry. The eyes of the six registered astonishment, mixed
      with craft and greed. &ldquo;I just robbed a house in Oakdale,&rdquo; explained the
      boy. &ldquo;I usually rob one every night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment his auditors were too surprised to voice a single emotion;
      but presently one murmured, soulfully: &ldquo;Pipe de swag!&rdquo; He of the frock
      coat, golf cap, and years waved a conciliatory hand. He tried to look at
      the boy's face; but for the life of him he couldn't raise his eyes above
      the dazzling wealth clutched in the fingers of those two small, slim
      hands. From one dangled a pearl necklace which alone might have ransomed,
      if not a king, at least a lesser member of a royal family, while diamonds,
      rubies, sapphires, and emeralds scintillated in the flaring light of the
      fire. Nor was the fistful of currency in the other hand to be sneezed at.
      There were greenbacks, it is true; but there were also yellowbacks with
      the reddish gold of large denominations. The Sky Pilot sighed a sigh that
      was more than half gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't yuh take a kid?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;I knew youse all along. Yuh can't
      fool an old bird like The Sky Pilot&mdash;eh, boys?&rdquo; and he turned to his
      comrades for confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's The Oskaloosa Kid,&rdquo; exclaimed one of the company. &ldquo;I'd know 'im
      anywheres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull up and set down,&rdquo; invited another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy stuffed his loot back into his pockets and came closer to the
      fire. Its warmth felt most comfortable, for the Spring night was growing
      chill. He looked about him at the motley company, some half-spruce in
      clothing that suggested a Kuppenmarx label and a not too far association
      with a tailor's goose, others in rags, all but one unshaven and all more
      or less dirty&mdash;for the open road is close to Nature, which is
      principally dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake hands with Dopey Charlie,&rdquo; said The Sky Pilot, whose age and
      corpulency appeared to stamp him with the hall mark of authority. The
      youth did as he was bid, smiling into the sullen, chalk-white face and
      taking the clammy hand extended toward him. Was it a shudder that passed
      through the lithe, young figure or was it merely a subconscious
      recognition of the final passing of the bodily cold before the glowing
      warmth of the blaze? &ldquo;And Soup Face,&rdquo; continued The Sky Pilot. A battered
      wreck half rose and extended a pudgy hand. Red whiskers, matted in little
      tangled wisps which suggested the dried ingredients of an infinite
      procession of semi-liquid refreshments, rioted promiscuously over a
      scarlet countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleased to meetcha,&rdquo; sprayed Soup Face. It was a strained smile which
      twisted the rather too perfect mouth of The Oskaloosa Kid, an appellation
      which we must, perforce, accept since the youth did not deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Columbus Blackie, The General, and Dirty Eddie were formally presented. As
      Dirty Eddie was, physically, the cleanest member of the band the youth
      wondered how he had come by his sobriquet&mdash;that is, he wondered until
      he heard Dirty Eddie speak, after which he was no longer in doubt. The
      Oskaloosa Kid, self-confessed 'tramp' and burglar, flushed at the lurid
      obscenity of Dirty Eddie's remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, bo,&rdquo; invited Soup Face. &ldquo;I guess you're a regular all right.
      Here, have a snifter?&rdquo; and he pulled a flask from his side pocket, holding
      it toward The Oskaloosa Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, but;&mdash;er&mdash;I'm on the wagon, you know,&rdquo; declined the
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a smoke?&rdquo; suggested Columbus Blackie. &ldquo;Here's the makin's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The change in the attitude of the men toward him pleased The Oskaloosa Kid
      immensely. They were treating him as one of them, and after the lonely
      walk through the dark and desolate farm lands human companionship of any
      kind was to him as the proverbial straw to the man who rocked the boat
      once too often.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dopey Charlie and The General, alone of all the company, waxed not
      enthusiastic over the advent of The Oskaloosa Kid and his priceless loot.
      These two sat scowling and whispering in the back-ground. &ldquo;Dat's a wrong
      guy,&rdquo; muttered the former to the latter. &ldquo;He's a stool pigeon or one of
      dese amatoor mugs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the pullin' of that punk graft that got my goat,&rdquo; replied The
      General. &ldquo;I never seen a punk yet that didn't try to make you think he was
      a wise guy an' dis stiff don't belong enough even to pull a spiel that
      would fool a old ladies' sewin' circle. I don't see wot The Sky Pilot's
      cozyin' up to him fer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't?&rdquo; scoffed Dopey Charlie. &ldquo;Didn't you lamp de oyster harness? To
      say nothin' of de mitful of rocks and kale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That 'ud be all right, too,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;if we could put the guy
      to sleep; but The Sky Pilot won't never stand for croakin' nobody. He's
      too scared of his neck. We'll look like a bunch o' wise ones, won't we?
      lettin' a stranger sit in now&mdash;after last night. Hell!&rdquo; he suddenly
      exploded. &ldquo;Don't you know that you an' me stand to swing if any of de
      bunch gets gabby in front of dis phoney punk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two sat silent for a while, The General puffing on a short briar,
      Dopey Charlie inhaling deep draughts from a cigarette, and both glaring
      through narrowed lids at the boy warming himself beside the fire where the
      others were attempting to draw him out the while they strove desperately
      but unavailingly to keep their eyes from the two bulging sidepockets of
      their guest's coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soup Face, who had been assiduously communing with a pint flask, leaned
      close to Columbus Blackie, placing his whiskers within an inch or so of
      the other's nose as was his habit when addressing another, and whispered,
      relative to the pearl necklace: &ldquo;Not a cent less 'n fifty thou, bo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fertheluvomike!&rdquo; ejaculated Blackie, drawing back and wiping a palm
      quickly across his lips. &ldquo;Get a plumber first if you want to kiss me&mdash;you
      leak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks you need a shower bath,&rdquo; said Dirty Eddie, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble with Soup Face,&rdquo; explained The Sky Pilot, &ldquo;is that he's got a
      idea he's a human atomizer an' that the rest of us has colds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't want no atomizer loaded with rot-gut and garlic shot in my
      mug,&rdquo; growled Blackie. &ldquo;What Soup Face needs is to be learned ettyket, an'
      if he comes that on me again I'm goin' to push his mush through the back
      of his bean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An ugly light came into the blear eyes of Soup Face. Once again he leaned
      close to Columbus Blackie. &ldquo;Not a cent less 'n fifty thou, you tinhorn!&rdquo;
       he bellowed, belligerent and sprayful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blackie leaped to his feet, with an oath&mdash;a frightful, hideous oath&mdash;and
      as he rose he swung a heavy fist to Soup Face's purple nose. The latter
      rolled over backward; but was upon his feet again much quicker than one
      would have expected in so gross a bulk, and as he came to his feet a knife
      flashed in his hand. With a sound that was more bestial than human he ran
      toward Blackie; but there was another there who had anticipated his
      intentions. As the blow was struck The Sky Pilot had risen; and now he
      sprang forward, for all his age and bulk as nimble as a cat, and seized
      Soup Face by the wrist. A quick wrench brought a howl of pain to the
      would-be assassin, and the knife fell to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gotta cut that if you travel with this bunch,&rdquo; said The Sky Pilot in
      a voice that was new to The Oskaloosa Kid; &ldquo;and you, too, Blackie,&rdquo; he
      continued. &ldquo;The rough stuff don't go with me, see?&rdquo; He hurled Soup Face to
      the floor and resumed his seat by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth was astonished at the physical strength of this old man,
      seemingly so softened by dissipation; but it showed him the source of The
      Sky Pilot's authority and its scope, for Columbus Blackie and Soup Face
      quitted their quarrel immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dirty Eddie rose, yawned and stretched. &ldquo;Me fer the hay,&rdquo; he announced,
      and lay down again with his feet toward the fire. Some of the others
      followed his example. &ldquo;You'll find some hay in the loft there,&rdquo; said The
      Sky Pilot to The Oskaloosa Kid. &ldquo;Bring it down an' make your bed here by
      me, there's plenty room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A half hour later all were stretched out upon the hard dirt floor upon
      improvised beds of rotted hay; but not all slept. The Oskaloosa Kid,
      though tired, found himself wider awake than he ever before had been.
      Apparently sleep could never again come to those heavy eyes. There passed
      before his mental vision a panorama of the events of the night. He smiled
      as he inaudibly voiced the name they had given him, the right to which he
      had not seen fit to deny. &ldquo;The Oskaloosa Kid.&rdquo; The boy smiled again as he
      felt the 'swag' hard and lumpy in his pockets. It had given him prestige
      here that he could not have gained by any other means; but he mistook the
      nature of the interest which his display of stolen wealth had aroused. He
      thought that the men now looked upon him as a fellow criminal to be
      accepted into the fraternity through achievement; whereas they suffered
      him to remain solely in the hope of transferring his loot to their own
      pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that he puzzled them. Even The Sky Pilot, the most astute and
      intelligent of them all, was at a loss to fathom The Oskaloosa Kid.
      Innocence and unsophistication flaunted their banners in almost every act
      and speech of The Oskaloosa Kid. The youth reminded him in some ways of
      members of a Sunday school which had flourished in the dim vistas of his
      past when, as an ordained minister of the Gospel, he had earned the
      sobriquet which now identified him. But the concrete evidence of the
      valuable loot comported not with The Sky Pilot's idea of a Sunday school
      boy's lark. The young fellow was, unquestionably, a thief; but that he had
      ever before consorted with thieves his speech and manners belied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got me,&rdquo; murmured The Sky Pilot; &ldquo;but he's got the stuff on him,
      too; and all I want is to get it off of him without a painful operation.
      Tomorrow'll do,&rdquo; and he shifted his position and fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dopey Charlie and The General did not, however, follow the example of
      their chief. They remained very wide awake, a little apart from the
      others, where their low whispers could not be overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better do it,&rdquo; urged The General, in a soft, insinuating voice.
      &ldquo;You're pretty slick with the toad stabber, an' any way one more or less
      won't count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can go to Sout' America on dat stuff an' live like gents,&rdquo; muttered
      Dopey Charlie. &ldquo;I'm goin' to cut out de Hop an' buy a farm an' a
      ottymobeel and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out of it,&rdquo; admonished The General. &ldquo;If we're lucky we'll get as far
      as Cincinnati, get a stew on and get pinched. Den one of us'll hang an' de
      other get stir fer life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General was a weasel faced person of almost any age between
      thirty-five and sixty. Sometimes he could have passed for a hundred and
      ten. He had won his military title as a boy in the famous march of Coxey's
      army on Washington, or, rather, the title had been conferred upon him in
      later years as a merited reward of service. The General, profiting by the
      precepts of his erstwhile companions in arms, had never soiled his
      military escutcheon by labor, nor had he ever risen to the higher planes
      of criminality. Rather as a mediocre pickpocket and a timorous confidence
      man had he eked out a meager existence, amply punctuated by seasons of
      straight bumming and intervals spent as the guest of various inhospitably
      hospitable states. Now, for the first time in his life, The General faced
      the possibility of a serious charge; and his terror made him what he never
      before had been, a dangerous criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a cheerful guy,&rdquo; commented Dopey Charlie; &ldquo;but you may be right at
      dat. Dey can't hang a guy any higher fer two 'an they can fer one an'
      dat's no pipe; so wots de use. Wait till I take a shot&mdash;it'll be
      easier,&rdquo; and he drew a small, worn case from an inside pocket, bared his
      arm to the elbow and injected enough morphine to have killed a dozen
      normal men.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a pile of mouldy hay across the barn the youth, heavy eyed but
      sleepless, watched the two through half closed lids. A qualm of disgust
      sent a sudden shudder through his slight frame. For the first time he
      almost regretted having embarked upon a life of crime. He had seen that
      the two men were conversing together earnestly, though he could over-hear
      nothing they said, and that he had been the subject of their nocturnal
      colloquy, for several times a glance or a nod in his direction assured him
      of this. And so he lay watching them&mdash;not that he was afraid, he kept
      reassuring himself, but through curiosity. Why should he be afraid? Was it
      not a well known truth that there was honor among thieves?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the longer he watched the heavier grew his lids. Several times they
      closed to be dragged open again only by painful effort. Finally came a
      time that they remained closed and the young chest rose and fell in the
      regular breathing of slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ragged, rat-hearted creatures rose silently and picked their way,
      half-crouched, among the sleepers sprawled between them and The Oskaloosa
      Kid. In the hand of Dopey Charlie gleamed a bit of shiny steel and in his
      heart were fear and greed. The fear was engendered by the belief that the
      youth might be an amateur detective. Dopey Charlie had had one experience
      of such and he knew that it was easily possible for them to blunder upon
      evidence which the most experienced of operatives might pass over
      unnoticed, and the loot bulging pockets furnished a sufficient greed
      motive in themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside the boy kneeled the man with the knife. He did not raise his hand
      and strike a sudden, haphazard blow. Instead he placed the point
      carefully, though lightly, above the victim's heart, and then, suddenly,
      bore his weight upon the blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abigail Prim always had been a thorn in the flesh of her stepmother&mdash;a
      well-meaning, unimaginative, ambitious, and rather common woman. Coming
      into the Prim home as house-keeper shortly after the death of Abigail's
      mother, the second Mrs. Prim had from the first looked upon Abigail
      principally as an obstacle to be overcome. She had tried to 'do right by
      her'; but she had never given the child what a child most needs and most
      craves&mdash;love and understanding. Not loving Abigail, the house-keeper
      could, naturally, not give her love; and as for understanding her one
      might as reasonably have expected an adding machine to understand higher
      mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas Prim loved his daughter. There was nothing, within reason, that
      money could buy which he would not have given her for the asking; but
      Jonas Prim's love, as his life, was expressed in dollar signs, while the
      love which Abigail craved is better expressed by any other means at the
      command of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being misunderstood and, to all outward appearances of sentiment and
      affection, unloved had not in any way embittered Abigail's remarkably
      joyous temperament. She made up for it in some measure by getting all the
      fun and excitement out of life which she could discover therein, or invent
      through the medium of her own resourceful imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      But recently the first real sorrow had been thrust into her young life
      since the half-forgotten mother had been taken from her. The second Mrs.
      Prim had decided that it was her 'duty' to see that Abigail, having
      finished school and college, was properly married. As a matchmaker the
      second Mrs. Prim was as a Texas steer in a ten cent store. It was nothing
      to her that Abigail did not wish to marry anyone, or that the man of Mrs.
      Prim's choice, had he been the sole surviving male in the Universe, would
      have still been as far from Abigail's choice as though he had been an
      inhabitant of one of Orion's most distant planets.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact Abigail Prim detested Samuel Benham because he
      represented to her everything in life which she shrank from&mdash;age,
      avoirdupois, infirmity, baldness, stupidity, and matrimony. He was a
      prosaic old bachelor who had amassed a fortune by the simple means of
      inheriting three farms upon which an industrial city subsequently had been
      built. Necessity rather than foresight had compelled him to hold on to his
      property; and six weeks of typhoid, arriving and departing, had saved him
      from selling out at a low figure. The first time he found himself able to
      be out and attend to business he likewise found himself a wealthy man, and
      ever since he had been growing wealthier without personal effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of which is to render evident just how impossible a matrimonial
      proposition was Samuel Benham to a bright, a beautiful, a gay, an
      imaginative, young, and a witty girl such as Abigail Prim, who cared less
      for money than for almost any other desirable thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nagged, scolded, reproached, pestered, threatened, Abigail had at last
      given a seeming assent to her stepmother's ambition; and had forthwith
      been packed off on a two weeks visit to the sister of the bride-groom
      elect. After which Mr. Benham was to visit Oakdale as a guest of the
      Prims, and at a dinner for which cards already had been issued&mdash;so
      sure was Mrs. Jonas Prim of her position of dictator of the Prim menage&mdash;the
      engagement was to be announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time after dinner on the night of Abigail's departure that
      Mrs. Prim, following a habit achieved by years of housekeeping, set forth
      upon her rounds to see that doors and windows were properly secured for
      the night. A French window and its screen opening upon the verandah from
      the library she found open. &ldquo;The house will be full of mosquitoes!&rdquo; she
      ejaculated mentally as she closed them both with a bang and made them
      fast. &ldquo;I should just like to know who left them open. Upon my word, I
      don't know what would become of this place if it wasn't for me. Of all the
      shiftlessness!&rdquo; and she turned and flounced upstairs. In Abigail's room
      she flashed on the center dome light from force of habit, although she
      knew that the room had been left in proper condition after the girl's
      departure earlier in the day. The first thing amiss that her eagle eye
      noted was the candlestick lying on the floor beside the dressing table. As
      she stooped to pick it up she saw the open drawer from which the small
      automatic had been removed, and then, suspicions, suddenly aroused, as
      suddenly became fear; and Mrs. Prim almost dove across the room to the
      hidden wall safe. A moment's investigation revealed the startling fact
      that the safe was unlocked and practically empty. It was then that Mrs.
      Jonas Prim screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her scream brought Jonas and several servants upon the scene. A careful
      inspection of the room disclosed the fact that while much of value had
      been ignored the burglar had taken the easily concealed contents of the
      wall safe which represented fully ninety percentum of the value of the
      personal property in Abigail Prim's apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Prim scowled suspiciously upon the servants. Who else, indeed, could
      have possessed the intimate knowledge which the thief had displayed. Mrs.
      Prim saw it all. The open library window had been but a clever blind to
      hide the fact that the thief had worked from the inside and was now
      doubtless in the house at that very moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jonas,&rdquo; she directed, &ldquo;call the police at once, and see that no one,
      absolutely no one, leaves this house until they have been here and made a
      full investigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks, Pudgy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Prim. &ldquo;You don't think the thief is waiting
      around here for the police, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that if you get the police here at once, Jonas, we shall find
      both the thief and the loot under our very roof,&rdquo; she replied, not without
      asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated. &ldquo;Why, Pudgy, you don't mean you
      suspect one of the servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else could have known?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Prim. The servants present looked
      uncomfortable and cast sheepish eyes of suspicion at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all tommy rot!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Prim; &ldquo;but I'll call the police,
      because I got to report the theft. It's some slick outsider, that's who it
      is,&rdquo; and he started down stairs toward the telephone. Before he reached it
      the bell rang, and when he had hung up the receiver after the conversation
      the theft seemed a trivial matter. In fact he had almost forgotten it, for
      the message had been from the local telegraph office relaying a wire they
      had just received from Mr. Samuel Benham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Pudgy,&rdquo; he cried, as he took the steps two at a time for the
      second floor, &ldquo;here's a wire from Benham saying Gail didn't come on that
      train and asking when he's to expect her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Prim. &ldquo;I certainly saw her aboard the train
      myself. Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jonas Prim was a man of action. Within half an hour he had set in motion
      such wheels as money and influence may cause to revolve in search of some
      clew to the whereabouts of the missing Abigail, and at the same time had
      reported the theft of jewels and money from his home; but in doing this he
      had learned that other happenings no less remarkable in their way had
      taken place in Oakdale that very night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning all Oakdale was thrilled as its fascinated eyes
      devoured the front page of Oakdale's ordinarily dull daily. Never had
      Oakdale experienced a plethora of home-grown thrills; but it came as near
      to it that morning, doubtless, as it ever had or ever will. Not since the
      cashier of The Merchants and Farmers Bank committed suicide three years
      past had Oakdale been so wrought up, and now that historic and classical
      event paled into insignificance in the glaring brilliancy of a series of
      crimes and mysteries of a single night such as not even the most sanguine
      of Oakdale's thrill lovers could have hoped for.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, first, the mysterious disappearance of Abigail Prim, the only
      daughter of Oakdale's wealthiest citizen; there was the equally mysterious
      robbery of the Prim home. Either one of these would have been sufficient
      to have set Oakdale's multitudinous tongues wagging for days; but they
      were not all. Old John Baggs, the city's best known miser, had suffered a
      murderous assault in his little cottage upon the outskirts of town, and
      was even now lying at the point of death in The Samaritan Hospital. That
      robbery had been the motive was amply indicated by the topsy-turvy
      condition of the contents of the three rooms which Baggs called home. As
      the victim still was unconscious no details of the crime were obtainable.
      Yet even this atrocious deed had been capped by one yet more hideous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reginald Paynter had for years been looked upon half askance and yet with
      a certain secret pride by Oakdale. He was her sole bon vivant in the true
      sense of the word, whatever that may be. He was always spoken of in the
      columns of The Oakdale Tribune as 'that well known man-about-town,' or
      'one of Oakdale's most prominent clubmen.' Reginald Paynter had been, if
      not the only, at all events the best dressed man in town. His clothes were
      made in New York. This in itself had been sufficient to have set him apart
      from all the other males of Oakdale. He was widely travelled, had an
      independent fortune, and was far from unhandsome. For years he had been
      the hope and despair of every Oakdale mother with marriageable daughters.
      The Oakdale fathers, however, had not been so keen about Reginald. Men
      usually know more about the morals of men than do women. There were those
      who, if pressed, would have conceded that Reginald had no morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what place has an obituary in a truthful tale of adventure and
      mystery! Reginald Paynter was dead. His body had been found beside the
      road just outside the city limits at mid-night by a party of automobilists
      returning from a fishing trip. The skull was crushed back of the left ear.
      The position of the body as well as the marks in the road beside it
      indicated that the man had been hurled from a rapidly moving automobile.
      The fact that his pockets had been rifled led to the assumption that he
      had been killed and robbed before being dumped upon the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there were those in Oakdale, and they were many, who endeavored to
      connect in some way these several events of horror, mystery, and crime. In
      the first place it seemed quite evident that the robbery at the Prim home,
      the assault upon Old Baggs, and the murder of Paynter had been the work of
      the same man; but how could such a series of frightful happenings be in
      any way connected with the disappearance of Abigail Prim? Of course there
      were many who knew that Abigail and Reginald were old friends; and that
      the former had, on frequent occasions, ridden abroad in Reginald's French
      roadster, that he had escorted her to parties and been, at various times,
      a caller at her home; but no less had been true of a dozen other perfectly
      respectable young ladies of Oakdale. Possibly it was only Abigail's added
      misfortune to have disappeared upon the eve of the night of Reginald's
      murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      But later in the day when word came from a nearby town that Reginald had
      been seen in a strange touring car with two unknown men and a girl, the
      gossips commenced to wag their heads. It was mentioned, casually of
      course, that this town was a few stations along the very road upon which
      Abigail had departed the previous afternoon for that destination which she
      had not reached. It was likewise remarked that Reginald, the two strange
      men and the GIRL had been first noticed after the time of arrival of the
      Oakdale train! What more was needed? Absolutely nothing more. The tongues
      ceased wagging in order that they might turn hand-springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Find Abigail Prim, whispered some, and the mystery will be solved. There
      were others charitable enough to assume that Abigail had been kidnapped by
      the same men who had murdered Paynter and wrought the other lesser deeds
      of crime in peaceful Oakdale. The Oakdale Tribune got out an extra that
      afternoon giving a resume of such evidence as had appeared in the regular
      edition and hinting at all the numerous possibilities suggested by such
      matter as had come to hand since. Even fear of old Jonas Prim and his
      millions had not been enough to entirely squelch the newspaper instinct of
      the Tribune's editor. Never before had he had such an opportunity and he
      made the best of it, even repeating the vague surmises which had linked
      the name of Abigail to the murder of Reginald Paynter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas Prim was too busy and too worried to pay any attention to the
      Tribune or its editor. He already had the best operative that the best
      detective agency in the nearest metropolis could furnish. The man had come
      to Oakdale, learned all that was to be learned there, and forthwith
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, will be about all concerning Oakdale for the present. We must
      leave her to bury her own dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden pressure of the knife point against the breast of the Oskaloosa
      Kid awakened the youth with a startling suddenness which brought him to
      his feet before a second vicious thrust reached him. For a time he did not
      realize how close he had been to death or that he had been saved by the
      chance location of the automatic pistol in his breast pocket&mdash;the
      very pistol he had taken from the dressing table of Abigail Prim's
      boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commotion of the attack and escape brought the other sleepers to
      heavy-eyed wakefulness. They saw Dopey Charlie advancing upon the Kid, a
      knife in his hand. Behind him slunk The General, urging the other on. The
      youth was backing toward the doorway. The tableau persisted but for an
      instant. Then the would-be murderer rushed madly upon his victim, the
      latter's hand leaped from beneath the breast of his torn coat&mdash;there
      was a flash of flame, a staccato report and Dopey Charlie crumpled to the
      ground, screaming. In the same instant The Oskaloosa Kid wheeled and
      vanished into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had all happened so quickly that the other members of the gang,
      awakened from deep slumber, had only time to stumble to their feet before
      it was over. The Sky Pilot, ignoring the screaming Charlie, thought only
      of the loot which had vanished with the Oskaloosa Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on! We gotta get him,&rdquo; he cried, as he ran from the barn after the
      fugitive. The others, all but Dopey Charlie, followed in the wake of their
      leader. The wounded man, his audience departed, ceased screaming and,
      sitting up, fell to examining himself. To his surprise he discovered that
      he was not dead. A further and more minute examination disclosed the
      additional fact that he was not even badly wounded. The bullet of The Kid
      had merely creased the flesh over the ribs beneath his right arm. With a
      grunt that might have been either disgust or relief he stumbled to his
      feet and joined in the pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the road toward the south ran The Oskaloosa Kid with all the
      fleetness of youth spurred on by terror. In five minutes he had so far
      outdistanced his pursuers that The Sky Pilot leaped to the conclusion that
      the quarry had left the road to hide in an adjoining field. The resultant
      halt and search upon either side of the road delayed the chase to a
      sufficient extent to award the fugitive a mile lead by the time the band
      resumed the hunt along the main highway. The men were determined to
      overhaul the youth not alone because of the loot upon his person but
      through an abiding suspicion that he might indeed be what some of them
      feared he was&mdash;an amateur detective&mdash;and there were at least two
      among them who had reason to be especially fearful of any sort of
      detective from Oakdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      They no longer ran; but puffed arduously along the smooth road, searching
      with troubled and angry eyes to right and left and ahead of them as they
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid puffed, too; but he puffed a mile away from the
      searchers and he walked more rapidly than they, for his muscles were
      younger and his wind unimpaired by dissipation. For a time he carried the
      small automatic in his hand; but later, hearing no evidence of pursuit, he
      returned it to the pocket in his coat where it had lain when it had saved
      him from death beneath the blade of the degenerate Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour he continued walking rapidly along the winding country road.
      He was very tired; but he dared not pause to rest. Always behind him he
      expected the sudden onslaught of the bearded, blear-eyed followers of The
      Sky Pilot. Terror goaded him to supreme physical effort. Recollection of
      the screaming man sinking to the earthen floor of the hay barn haunted
      him. He was a murderer! He had slain a fellow man. He winced and
      shuddered, increasing his gait until again he almost ran &mdash;ran from
      the ghost pursuing him through the black night in greater terror than he
      felt for the flesh and blood pursuers upon his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Nature drew upon her sinister forces to add to the fear which the
      youth already felt. Black clouds obscured the moon blotting out the soft
      kindliness of the greening fields and transforming the budding branches of
      the trees to menacing and gloomy arms which appeared to hover with
      clawlike talons above the dark and forbidding road. The wind soughed with
      gloomy and increasing menace, a sudden light flared across the southern
      sky followed by the reverberation of distant thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a great rain drop was blown against the youth's face; the
      vividness of the lightning had increased; the rumbling of the thunder had
      grown to the proportions of a titanic bombardment; but he dared not pause
      to seek shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another flash of lightning revealed a fork in the road immediately ahead&mdash;to
      the left ran the broad, smooth highway, to the right a dirt road,
      overarched by trees, led away into the impenetrable dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fugitive paused, undecided. Which way should he turn? The better
      travelled highway seemed less mysterious and awesome, yet would his
      pursuers not naturally assume that he had followed it? Then, of course,
      the right hand road was the road for him. Yet still he hesitated, for the
      right hand road was black and forbidding; suggesting the entrance to a pit
      of unknown horrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there with the rain and the wind, the thunder and the
      lightning, horror of the past and terror of the future his only companions
      there broke suddenly through the storm the voice of a man just ahead and
      evidently approaching along the highway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth turned to flee; but the thought of the men tracking him from
      that direction brought him to a sudden halt. There was only the road to
      the right, then, after all. Cautiously he moved toward it, and at the same
      time the words of the voice came clearly through the night:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;'... as, swinging heel and toe,

     'We tramped the road to Anywhere, the magic road

           to Anywhere,

     'The tragic road to Anywhere, such dear, dim years

           ago.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The voice seemed reassuring&mdash;its quality and the annunciation of the
      words bespoke for its owner considerable claim to refinement. The youth
      had halted again, but he now crouched to one side fearing to reveal his
      presence because of the bloody crime he thought he had committed; yet how
      he yearned to throw himself upon the compassion of this fine voiced
      stranger! How his every fibre cried out for companionship in this night of
      his greatest terror; but he would have let the invisible minstrel pass had
      not Fate ordained to light the scene at that particular instant with a
      prolonged flare of sheet lightning, revealing the two wayfarers to one
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth saw a slight though well built man in ragged clothes and
      disreputable soft hat. The image was photographed upon his brain for life&mdash;the
      honest, laughing eyes, the well moulded features harmonizing so well with
      the voice, and the impossible garments which marked the man hobo and bum
      as plainly as though he wore a placard suspended from his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger halted. Once more darkness enveloped them. &ldquo;Lovely evening
      for a stroll,&rdquo; remarked the man. &ldquo;Running out to your country place? Isn't
      there danger of skidding on these wet roads at night? I told James, just
      before we started, to be sure to see that the chains were on all around;
      but he forgot them. James is very trying sometimes. Now he never showed up
      this evening and I had to start out alone, and he knows perfectly well
      that I detest driving after dark in the rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth found himself smiling. His fear had suddenly vanished. No one
      could harbor suspicion of the owner of that cheerful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know which road to take,&rdquo; he ventured, in explanation of his
      presence at the cross road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed the man, &ldquo;are there two roads here? I was looking for this
      fork and came near passing it in the dark. It was a year ago since I came
      this way; but I recall a deserted house about a mile up the dirt road. It
      will shelter us from the inclemencies of the weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the youth. &ldquo;Now I know where I am. In the dark and the storm
      and after all that has happened to me tonight nothing seemed natural. It
      was just as though I was in some strange land; but I know now. Yes, there
      is a deserted house a little less than a mile from here; but you wouldn't
      want to stop there at night. They tell some frightful stories about it. It
      hasn't been occupied for over twenty years&mdash;not since the Squibbs
      were found murdered there&mdash;the father, mother, three sons, and a
      daughter. They never discovered the murderer, and the house has stood
      vacant and the farm unworked almost continuously since. A couple of men
      tried working it; but they didn't stay long. A night or so was enough for
      them and their families. I remember hearing as a little&mdash;er&mdash;child
      stories of the frightful things that happened there in the house where the
      Squibbs were murdered&mdash;things that happened after dark when the
      lights were out. Oh, I wouldn't even pass that place on a night like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled. &ldquo;I slept there alone one rainy night about a year ago,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I didn't see or hear anything unusual. Such stories are ridiculous;
      and even if there was a little truth in them, noises can't harm you as
      much as sleeping out in the storm. I'm going to encroach once more upon
      the ghostly hospitality of the Squibbs. Better come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth shuddered and drew back. From far behind came faintly the shout
      of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'll go,&rdquo; exclaimed the boy. &ldquo;Let's hurry,&rdquo; and he started off at a
      half-run toward the dirt road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man followed more slowly. The darkness hid the quizzical expression of
      his eyes. He, too, had heard the faint shout far to the rear. He recalled
      the boy's &ldquo;after all that has happened to me tonight,&rdquo; and he shrewdly
      guessed that the latter's sudden determination to brave the horrors of the
      haunted house was closely connected with the hoarse voice out of the
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finally come abreast of the youth after the latter, his first
      panic of flight subsided, had reduced his speed, he spoke to him in his
      kindly tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it that happened to you to-night?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Is someone
      following you? You needn't be afraid of me. I'll help you if you've been
      on the square. If you haven't, you still needn't fear me, for I won't
      peach on you. What is it? Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth was on the point of unburdening his soul to this stranger with
      the kindly voice and the honest eyes; but a sudden fear stayed his tongue.
      If he told all it would be necessary to reveal certain details that he
      could not bring himself to reveal to anyone, and so he commenced with his
      introduction to the wayfarers in the deserted hay barn. Briefly he told of
      the attack upon him, of his shooting of Dopey Charlie, of the flight and
      pursuit. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said in conclusion, &ldquo;that you know I'm a murderer I
      suppose you won't have any more to do with me, unless you turn me over to
      the authorities to hang.&rdquo; There was almost a sob in his voice, so real was
      his terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man threw an arm across his companion's shoulder. &ldquo;Don't worry, kid,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;You're not a murderer even if you did kill Dopey Charlie, which
      I hope you did. You're a benefactor of the human race. I have known
      Charles for years. He should have been killed long since. Furthermore, as
      you shot in self defence no jury would convict you. I fear, however, that
      you didn't kill him. You say you could hear his screams as long as you
      were within earshot of the barn&mdash;dead men don't scream, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know my name?&rdquo; asked the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you called me 'Kid' and that's my name&mdash;I'm The Oskaloosa Kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was glad that the darkness hid his smile of amusement. He knew The
      Oskaloosa Kid well, and he knew him as an ex-pug with a pock marked face,
      a bullet head, and a tin ear. The flash of lightning had revealed, upon
      the contrary, a slender boy with smooth skin, an oval face, and large dark
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so you are The Oskaloosa Kid! I am delighted, sir, to make
      your acquaintance. Permit me to introduce myself: my name is Bridge. If
      James were here I should ask him to mix one of his famous cocktails that
      we might drink to our mutual happiness and the longevity of our
      friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to know you, Mr. Bridge,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;Oh, I can't tell you
      how glad I am to know you. I was so lonely and so afraid,&rdquo; and he pressed
      closer to the older man whose arm still encircled his shoulder, though at
      first he had been inclined to draw away in some confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talking together the two moved on along the dark road. The storm had
      settled now into a steady rain with infrequent flashes of lightning and
      peals of thunder. There had been no further indications of pursuit; but
      Bridge argued that The Sky Pilot, being wise with the wisdom of the owl
      and cunning with the cunning of the fox, would doubtless surmise that a
      fugitive would take to the first road leading away from the main artery,
      and that even though they heard nothing it would be safe to assume that
      the gang was still upon the boy's trail. &ldquo;And it's a bad bunch, too,&rdquo; he
      continued. &ldquo;I've known them all for years. The Sky Pilot has the
      reputation of never countenancing a murder; but that is because he is a
      sly one. His gang kills; but when they kill under The Sky Pilot they do it
      so cleverly that no trace of the crime remains. Their victim disappears&mdash;that
      is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy trembled. &ldquo;You won't let them get me?&rdquo; he pleaded, pressing closer
      to the man. The only response was a pressure of the arm about the
      shoulders of The Oskaloosa Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over a low hill they followed the muddy road and down into a dark and
      gloomy ravine. In a little open space to the right of the road a flash of
      lightning revealed the outlines of a building a hundred yards from the
      rickety and decaying fence which bordered the Squibbs' farm and separated
      it from the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; cried Bridge, &ldquo;and spooks or no spooks we'll find a dry
      spot in that old ruin. There was a stove there last year and it's
      doubtless there yet. A good fire to dry our clothes and warm us up will
      fit us for a bully good sleep, and I'll wager a silk hat that The
      Oskaloosa Kid is a mighty sleepy kid, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy admitted the allegation and the two turned in through the gateway,
      stepping over the fallen gate and moving through knee high weeds toward
      the forbidding structure in the distance. A clump of trees surrounded the
      house, their shade adding to the almost utter blackness of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two had reached the verandah when Bridge, turning, saw a brilliant
      light flaring through the night above the crest of the hill they had just
      topped in their descent into the ravine, or, to be more explicit, the
      small valley, where stood the crumbling house of Squibbs. The purr of a
      rapidly moving motor rose above the rain, the light rose, fell, swerved to
      the right and to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone must be in a hurry,&rdquo; commented Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is James, anxious to find you and explain his absence,&rdquo;
       suggested The Oskaloosa Kid. They both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; cried Bridge, as the car topped the hill and plunged downward
      toward them, &ldquo;I'd hate to ride behind that fellow on a night like this,
      and over a dirt road at that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the car swung onto the straight road before the house a flash of
      lightning revealed dimly the outlines of a rapidly moving touring car with
      lowered top. Just as the machine came opposite the Squibbs' gate a woman's
      scream mingled with the report of a pistol from the tonneau and the
      watchers upon the verandah saw a dark bulk hurled from the car, which sped
      on with undiminished speed, climbed the hill beyond and disappeared from
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge started on a run toward the gateway, followed by the frightened
      Kid. In the ditch beside the road they found in a dishevelled heap the
      body of a young woman. The man lifted the still form in his arms. The
      youth wondered at the great strength of the slight figure. &ldquo;Let me help
      you carry her,&rdquo; he volunteered; but Bridge needed no assistance. &ldquo;Run
      ahead and open the door for me,&rdquo; he said, as he bore his burden toward the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgetful, in the excitement of the moment, of his terror of the horror
      ridden ruin, The Oskaloosa Kid hastened ahead, mounted the few steps to
      the verandah, crossed it and pushed open the sagging door. Behind him came
      Bridge as the youth entered the dark interior. A half dozen steps he took
      when his foot struck against a soft and yielding mass. Stumbling, he tried
      to regain his equilibrium only to drop full upon the thing beneath him.
      One open palm, extended to ease his fall, fell upon the upturned features
      of a cold and clammy face. With a shriek of horror The Kid leaped to his
      feet and shrank, trembling, back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? What's the matter?&rdquo; cried Bridge, with whom The Kid had
      collided in his precipitate retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-o-o!&rdquo; groaned The Kid, shuddering. &ldquo;It's dead! It's dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's dead?&rdquo; demanded Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a dead man on the floor, right ahead of us,&rdquo; moaned The Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find a flash lamp in the right hand pocket of my coat,&rdquo; directed
      Bridge. &ldquo;Take it and make a light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With trembling fingers the Kid did as he was bid, and when after much
      fumbling he found the button a slim shaft of white light fell downward
      upon the upturned face of a man cold in death&mdash;a little man,
      strangely garbed, with gold rings in his ears, and long black hair matted
      in the death sweat of his brow. His eyes were wide and, even in death,
      terror filled, his features were distorted with fear and horror. His
      fingers, clenched in the rigidity of death, clutched wisps of dark brown
      hair. There were no indications of a wound or other violence upon his
      body, that either the Kid or Bridge could see, except the dried remains of
      bloody froth which flecked his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge still stood holding the quiet form of the girl in his arms, while
      The Kid, pressed close to the man's side, clutched one arm with a fierce
      intensity which bespoke at once the nervous terror which filled him and
      the reliance he placed upon his new found friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      To their right, in the faint light of the flash lamp, a narrow stairway
      was revealed leading to the second story. Straight ahead was a door
      opening upon the blackness of a rear apartment. Beside the foot of the
      stairway was another door leading to the cellar steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge nodded toward the rear room. &ldquo;The stove is in there,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;We'd better go on and make a fire. Draw your pistol&mdash;whoever did
      this has probably beat it; but it's just as well to be on the safe side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid,&rdquo; said The Oskaloosa Kid. &ldquo;Let's leave this frightful place.
      It's just as I told you it was; just as I always heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't leave this woman, my boy,&rdquo; replied Bridge. &ldquo;She isn't dead. We
      can't leave her, and we can't take her out into the storm in her
      condition. We must stay. Come! buck up. There's nothing to fear from a
      dead man, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He never finished the sentence. From the depths of the cellar came the
      sound of a clanking chain. Something scratched heavily upon the wooden
      steps. Whatever it was it was evidently ascending, while behind it clanked
      the heavy links of a dragged chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid cast a wide eyed glance of terror at Bridge. His lips
      moved in an attempt to speak; but fear rendered him inarticulate. Slowly,
      ponderously the THING ascended the dark stairs from the gloom ridden
      cellar of the deserted ruin. Even Bridge paled a trifle. The man upon the
      floor appeared to have met an unnatural death&mdash;the frightful
      expression frozen upon the dead face might even indicate something verging
      upon the supernatural. The sound of the THING climbing out of the cellar
      was indeed uncanny&mdash;so uncanny that Bridge discovered himself looking
      about for some means of escape. His eyes fell upon the stairway leading to
      the second floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Up the stairs! You go first; I'll follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Kid needed no second invitation. With a bound he was half way up the
      rickety staircase; but a glance ahead at the darkness above gave him pause
      while he waited for Bridge to catch up with him. Coming more slowly with
      his burden the man followed the boy, while from below the clanking of the
      chain warned them that the THING was already at the top of the cellar
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flash the lamp down there,&rdquo; directed Bridge. &ldquo;Let's have a look at it,
      whatever it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With trembling hands The Oskaloosa Kid directed the lens over the edge of
      the swaying and rotting bannister. His finger slipped from the lighting
      button plunging them all into darkness. In his frantic effort to find the
      button and relight the lamp the worst occurred&mdash;he fumbled the button
      and the lamp slipped through his fingers, falling over the bannister to
      the floor below. Instantly the sound of the dragging chain ceased; but the
      silence was even more horrible than the noise which had preceded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long minute the two at the head of the stairs stood in tense silence
      listening for a repetition of the gruesome sounds from below. The youth
      was frankly terrified; he made no effort to conceal the fact; but pressed
      close to his companion, again clutching his arm tightly. Bridge could feel
      the trembling of the slight figure, the spasmodic gripping of the slender
      fingers and hear the quick, short, irregular breathing. A sudden impulse
      to throw a protecting arm about the boy seized him&mdash;an impulse which
      he could not quite fathom, and one to which he could not respond because
      of the body of the girl he carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent toward the youth. &ldquo;There are matches in my coat pocket,&rdquo; he
      whispered, &ldquo;&mdash;the same pocket in which you found the flash lamp.
      Strike one and we'll look for a room here where we can lay the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy fumbled gropingly in search of the matches. It was evident to the
      man that it was only with the greatest exertion of will power that he
      controlled his muscles at all; but at last he succeeded in finding and
      striking one. At the flare of the light there was a sound from below&mdash;a
      scratching sound and the creaking of boards as beneath a heavy body; then
      came the clanking of the chain once more, and the bannister against which
      they leaned shook as though a hand had been laid upon it below them. The
      youth stifled a shriek and simultaneously the match went out; but not
      before Bridge had seen in the momentary flare of light a partially open
      door at the far end of the hall in which they stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath them the stairs creaked now and the chain thumped slowly from one
      to another as it was dragged upward toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; called Bridge. &ldquo;Straight down the hall and into the room at the
      end.&rdquo; The man was puzzled. He could not have been said to have been
      actually afraid, and yet the terror of the boy was so intense, so real,
      that it could scarce but have had its suggestive effect upon the other;
      and, too, there was an uncanny element of the supernatural in what they
      had seen and heard in the deserted house&mdash;the dead man on the floor
      below, the inexplicable clanking of a chain by some unseen THING from the
      depth of the cellar upward toward them; and, to heighten the effect of
      these, there were the grim stories of unsolved tragedy and crime. All in
      all Bridge could not have denied that he was glad of the room at the end
      of the hall with its suggestion of safety in the door which might be
      closed against the horrors of the hall and the Stygian gloom below stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid was staggering ahead of him, scarce able to hold his
      body erect upon his shaking knees&mdash;his gait seemed pitifully slow to
      the unarmed man carrying the unconscious girl and listening to the chain
      dragging ever nearer and nearer behind; but at last they reached the
      doorway and passed through it into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close the door,&rdquo; directed Bridge as he crossed toward the center of the
      room to lay his burden upon the floor, but there was no response to his
      instructions&mdash;only a gasp and the sound of a body slumping to the
      rotting boards. With an exclamation of chagrin the man dropped the girl
      and swung quickly toward the door. Halfway down the hall he could hear the
      chain rattling over loose planking, the THING, whatever it might be, was
      close upon them. Bridge slammed-to the door and with a shoulder against it
      drew a match from his pocket and lighted it. Although his clothing was
      soggy with rain he knew that his matches would still be dry, for this
      pocket and its flap he had ingeniously lined with waterproof material from
      a discarded slicker he had found&mdash;years of tramping having taught him
      the discomforts of a fireless camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the resultant light the man saw with a quick glance a large room
      furnished with an old walnut bed, dresser, and commode; two lightless
      windows opened at the far end toward the road, Bridge assumed; and there
      was no door other than that against which he leaned. In the last flicker
      of the match the man scanned the door itself for a lock and, to his
      relief, discovered a bolt&mdash;old and rusty it was, but it still moved
      in its sleeve. An instant later it was shot&mdash;just as the sound of the
      dragging chain ceased outside. Near the door was the great bed, and this
      Bridge dragged before it as an additional barricade; then, bearing nothing
      more from the hallway, he turned his attention to the two unconscious
      forms upon the floor. Unhesitatingly he went to the boy first though had
      he questioned himself he could not have told why; for the youth,
      undoubtedly, had only swooned, while the girl had been the victim of a
      murderous assault and might even be at the point of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the appeal to the man in the pseudo Oskaloosa Kid? He had scarce
      seen the boy's face, yet the terrified figure had aroused within him,
      strongly, the protective instinct. Doubtless it was the call of youth and
      weakness which find, always, an answering assurance in the strength of a
      strong man.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Bridge groped toward the spot where the boy had fallen his eyes, now
      become accustomed to the darkness of the room, saw that the youth was
      sitting up. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Feeling better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it? Oh, God! Where is it?&rdquo; cried the boy. &ldquo;It will come in here
      and kill us as it killed that&mdash;that&mdash;down stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't get in,&rdquo; Bridge assured him. &ldquo;I've locked the door and pushed
      the bed in front of it. Gad! I feel like an old maid looking under the bed
      for burglars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the hall came a sudden clanking of the chain accompanied by a loud
      pounding upon the bare floor. With a scream the youth leaped to his feet
      and almost threw himself upon Bridge. His arms were about the man's neck,
      his face buried in his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't&mdash;don't let it get me!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brace up, son,&rdquo; Bridge admonished him. &ldquo;Didn't I tell you that it can't
      get in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it can't get in?&rdquo; whimpered the youth. &ldquo;It's the thing
      that murdered the man down stairs&mdash;it's the thing that murdered the
      Squibbs&mdash;right here in this room. It got in to them&mdash;what is to
      prevent its getting in to us. What are doors to such a THING?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come! now,&rdquo; Bridge tried to soothe him. &ldquo;You have a case of nerves.
      Lie down here on this bed and try to sleep. Nothing shall harm you, and
      when you wake up it will be morning and you'll laugh at your fears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie on THAT bed!&rdquo; The voice was almost a shriek. &ldquo;That is the bed the
      Squibbs were murdered in&mdash;the old man and his wife. No one would have
      it, and so it has remained here all these years. I would rather die than
      touch the thing. Their blood is still upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Bridge a trifle sternly, &ldquo;that you would try to control
      yourself a bit. Hysteria won't help us any. Here we are, and we've to make
      the best of it. Besides we must look after this young woman&mdash;she may
      be dying, and we haven't done a thing to help her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy, evidently shamed, released his hold upon Bridge and moved away.
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll try to do better; but, Oh! I was so
      frightened. You cannot imagine how frightened I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had imagined,&rdquo; said Bridge, &ldquo;from what I had heard of him that it would
      be a rather difficult thing to frighten The Oskaloosa Kid&mdash;you have,
      you know, rather a reputation for fearlessness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The darkness hid the scarlet flush which mantled The Kid's face. There was
      a moment's silence as Bridge crossed to where the young woman still lay
      upon the floor where he had deposited her. Then The Kid spoke. &ldquo;I'm
      sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I made a fool of myself. You have been so brave,
      and I have not helped at all. I shall do better now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Bridge, and stooped to raise the young woman in his arms and
      deposit her upon the bed. Then he struck another match and leaned close to
      examine her. The flare of the sulphur illuminated the room and shot two
      rectangles of light against the outer blackness where the unglazed windows
      stared vacantly upon the road beyond, bringing to a sudden halt a little
      company of muddy and bedraggled men who slipped, cursing, along the slimy
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge felt the youth close beside him as he bent above the girl upon the
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she dead?&rdquo; the lad whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Bridge, &ldquo;and I doubt if she's badly hurt.&rdquo; His hands ran
      quickly over her limbs, bending and twisting them gently; he unbuttoned
      her waist, getting the boy to strike and hold another match while he
      examined the victim for signs of a bullet wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't find a scratch on her,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;She's suffering from
      shock alone, as far as I can judge. Say, she's pretty, isn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth drew himself rather stiffly erect. &ldquo;Her features are rather
      coarse, I think,&rdquo; he replied. There was a peculiar quality to the tone
      which caused Bridge to turn a quick look at the boy's face, just as the
      match flickered and went out. The darkness hid the expression upon
      Bridge's face, but his conviction that the girl was pretty was unaltered.
      The light of the match had revealed an oval face surrounded by dark,
      dishevelled tresses, red, full lips, and large, dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further discussion of the young woman was discouraged by a repetition of
      the clanking of the chain without. Now it was receding along the hallway
      toward the stairs and presently, to the infinite relief of The Oskaloosa
      Kid, the two heard it descending to the lower floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, do you think?&rdquo; asked the boy, his voice still trembling upon
      the verge of hysteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied Bridge. &ldquo;I've never been a believer in ghosts and
      I'm not now; but I'll admit that it takes a whole lot of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish the sentence for a moan from the bed diverted his
      attention to the injured girl, toward whom he now turned. As they listened
      for a repetition of the sound there came another&mdash;that of the
      creaking of the old bed slats as the girl moved upon the mildewed
      mattress. Dimly, through the darkness, Bridge saw that the victim of the
      recent murderous assault was attempting to sit up. He moved closer and
      leaned above her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't exert myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You've just suffered an accident, and
      it's better that you remain quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the girl, a note of suppressed terror in her voice.
      &ldquo;You are not&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no one you know,&rdquo; replied Bridge. &ldquo;My friend and I chanced to be
      near when you fell from the car&mdash;&rdquo; with that innate refinement which
      always belied his vocation and his rags Bridge chose not to embarrass the
      girl by a too intimate knowledge of the thing which had befallen her,
      preferring to leave to her own volition the making of any explanation she
      saw fit, or of none&mdash;&ldquo;and we carried you in here out of the storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was silent for a moment. &ldquo;Where is 'here'?&rdquo; she asked presently.
      &ldquo;They drove so fast and it was so dark that I had no idea where we were,
      though I know that we left the turnpike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are at the old Squibbs place,&rdquo; replied the man. He could see that the
      girl was running one hand gingerly over her head and face, so that her
      next question did not surprise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I badly wounded?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Do you think that I am going to die?&rdquo;
       The tremor in her voice was pathetic&mdash;it was the voice of a
      frightened and wondering child. Bridge heard the boy behind him move
      impulsively forward and saw him kneel on the bed beside the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not badly hurt,&rdquo; volunteered The Oskaloosa Kid. &ldquo;Bridge couldn't
      find a mark on you&mdash;the bullet must have missed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was holding me over the edge of the car when he fired.&rdquo; The girl's
      voice reflected the physical shudder which ran through her frame at the
      recollection. &ldquo;Then he threw me out almost simultaneously. I suppose he
      thought that he could not miss at such close range.&rdquo; For a time she was
      silent again, sitting stiffly erect. Bridge could feel rather than see
      wide, tense eyes staring out through the darkness upon scenes, horrible
      perhaps, that were invisible to him and the Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the girl turned and threw herself face downward upon the bed. &ldquo;O,
      God!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Father! Father! It will kill you&mdash;no one will
      believe me&mdash;they will think that I am bad. I didn't do it! I didn't
      do it! I've been a silly little fool; but I have never been a bad girl&mdash;and&mdash;-and&mdash;I
      had nothing to do with that awful thing that happened to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge and the boy realized that she was not talking to them&mdash;that
      for the moment she had lost sight of their presence&mdash;she was talking
      to that father whose heart would be breaking with the breaking of the new
      day, trying to convince him that his little girl had done no wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she sat up, and when she spoke there was no tremor in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may die,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to die. I do not see how I can go on living
      after last night; but if I do die I want my father to know that I had
      nothing to do with it and that they tried to kill me because I wouldn't
      promise to keep still. It was the little one who murdered him&mdash;the
      one they called 'Jimmie' and 'The Oskaloosa Kid.' The big one drove the
      car&mdash;his name was 'Terry.' After they killed him I tried to jump out&mdash;I
      had been sitting in front with Terry&mdash;and then they dragged me over
      into the tonneau and later&mdash;the Oskaloosa Kid tried to kill me too,
      and threw me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge heard the boy at his side gulp. The girl went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow you will know about the murder&mdash;everyone will know about
      it; and I will be missed; and there will be people who saw me in the car
      with them, for someone must have seen me. Oh, I can't face it! I want to
      die. I will die! I come of a good family. My father is a prominent man. I
      can't go back and stand the disgrace and see him suffer, as he will
      suffer, for I was all he had&mdash;his only child. I can't bear to tell
      you my name&mdash;you will know it soon enough&mdash;but please find some
      way to let my father know all that I have told you&mdash;I swear that it
      is the truth&mdash;by the memory of my dead mother, I swear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge laid a hand upon the girl's shoulder. &ldquo;If you are telling us the
      truth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have only a silly escapade with strange men upon
      your conscience. You must not talk of dying now&mdash;your duty is to your
      father. If you take your own life it will be a tacit admission of guilt
      and will only serve to double the burden of sorrow and ignominy which your
      father is bound to feel when this thing becomes public, as it certainly
      must if a murder has been done. The only way in which you can atone for
      your error is to go back and face the consequences with him&mdash;do not
      throw it all upon him; that would be cowardly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not reply; but that the man's words had impressed her seemed
      evident. For a while each was occupied with his own thoughts; which were
      presently disturbed by the sound of footsteps upon the floor below&mdash;the
      muffled scraping of many feet followed a moment later by an exclamation
      and an oath, the words coming distinctly through the loose and splintered
      flooring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pipe the stiff,&rdquo; exclaimed a voice which The Oskaloosa Kid recognized
      immediately as that of Soup Face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Kid musta croaked him,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      A laugh followed this evidently witty sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The guy probably lamped the swag an' died of heart failure,&rdquo; suggested
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were still laughing when the sound of a clanking chain echoed
      dismally from the cellar. Instantly silence fell upon the newcomers upon
      the first floor, followed by a&mdash;&ldquo;Wotinel's that?&rdquo; Two of the men had
      approached the staircase and started to ascend it. Slowly the uncanny
      clanking drew closer to the first floor. The girl on the bed turned toward
      Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't know,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;It followed us up here, or rather it
      chased us up; and then went down again just before you regained
      consciousness. I imagine we shall hear some interesting developments from
      below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's The Sky Pilot and his gang,&rdquo; whispered The Oskaloosa Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's The Oskaloosa Kid,&rdquo; came a voice from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wot was that light upstairs then?&rdquo; queried another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' wot croaked this guy here?&rdquo; asked a third. &ldquo;It wasn't nothin' nice&mdash;did
      you get the expression on his mug an' the red foam on his lips? I tell
      youse there's something in this house beside human bein's. I know the
      joint&mdash;it's hanted&mdash;they's spooks in it. Gawd! there it is now,&rdquo;
       as the clanking rose to the head of the cellar stairs; and those above
      heard a sudden rush of footsteps as the men broke for the open air&mdash;all
      but the two upon the stairway. They had remained too long and now, their
      retreat cut off, they scrambled, cursing and screaming, to the second
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the hallway they rushed to the closed door at the end&mdash;the door
      of the room in which the three listened breathlessly&mdash;hurling
      themselves against it in violent effort to gain admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you and what do you want?&rdquo; cried Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us in! Let us in!&rdquo; screamed two voices. &ldquo;Fer God's sake let us in.
      Can't you hear IT? It'll be comin' up here in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the dragging chain could be heard at intervals upon the floor
      below. It seemed to the tense listeners above to pause beside the dead man
      as though hovering in gloating exultation above its gruesome prey and then
      it moved again, this time toward the stairway where they all heard it
      ascending with a creepy slowness which wrought more terribly upon tense
      nerves than would a sudden rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mills of the Gods grind slowly,&rdquo; quoted Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't!&rdquo; pleaded The Oskaloosa Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us in,&rdquo; screamed the men without. &ldquo;Fer the luv o' Mike have a heart!
      Don't leave us out here! IT's comin'! IT's comin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let the poor things in,&rdquo; pleaded the girl on the bed. She was,
      herself, trembling with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No funny business, now, if I let you in,&rdquo; commanded Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the square,&rdquo; came the quick and earnest reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The THING had reached the head of the stairs when Bridge dragged the bed
      aside and drew the bolt. Instantly two figures hurled themselves into the
      room but turned immediately to help Bridge resecure the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as it had done before, when Bridge and The Oskaloosa Kid had taken
      refuge there with the girl, the THING moved down the hallway to the closed
      door. The dragging chain marked each foot of its advance. If it made other
      sounds they were drowned by the clanking of the links over the time
      roughened flooring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the room the five were frozen into utter silence, and beyond the
      door an equal quiet prevailed for a long minute; then a great force made
      the door creak and a weird scratching sounded high up upon the old
      fashioned panelling. Bridge heard a smothered gasp from the boy beside
      him, followed instantly by a flash of flame and the crack of a small
      caliber automatic; The Oskaloosa Kid had fired through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge seized the boy's arm and wrenched the weapon from him. &ldquo;Be
      careful!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You'll hurt someone. You didn't miss the girl much
      that time&mdash;she's on the bed right in front of the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid pressed closer to the man as though he sought protection
      from the unknown menace without. The girl sprang from the bed and crossed
      to the opposite side of the room. A flash of lightning illuminated the
      chamber for an instant and the roof of the verandah without. The girl
      noted the latter and the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Suppose it went out of another window upon this porch.
      It could get us so easily that way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, you fool!&rdquo; whispered one of the two newcomers. &ldquo;It might hear
      you.&rdquo; The girl subsided into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sound from the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you croaked IT,&rdquo; suggested the second newcomer, hopefully; but,
      as though the THING without had heard and understood, the clanking of the
      chain recommenced at once; but now it was retreating along the hallway,
      and soon they heard it descending the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sighs of relief escaped more than a single pair of lips. &ldquo;IT didn't hear
      me,&rdquo; whispered the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge laughed. &ldquo;We're a nice lot of babies seeing things at night,&rdquo; he
      scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're so nervy why don't you go down an' see wot it is?&rdquo; asked one of
      the late arrivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I shall,&rdquo; replied Bridge and pulled the bed away from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly a chorus of protests arose, the girl and The Oskaloosa Kid being
      most insistent. What was the use? What good could he accomplish? It might
      be nothing; yet on the other hand what had brought death so horribly to
      the cold clay on the floor below? At last their pleas prevailed and Bridge
      replaced the bed before the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two hours the five sat about the room waiting for daylight. There
      could be no sleep for any of them. Occasionally they spoke, usually
      advancing and refuting suggestions as to the identity of the nocturnal
      prowler below-stairs. The THING seemed to have retreated again to the
      cellar, leaving the upper floor to the five strangely assorted prisoners
      and the first floor to the dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the brief intervals of conversation the girl repeated snatches of
      her story and once she mentioned The Oskaloosa Kid as the murderer of the
      unnamed victim. The two men who had come last pricked up their ears at
      this and Bridge felt the boy's hand just touch his arm as though in mute
      appeal for belief and protection. The man half smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We seen The Oskaloosa Kid this evenin',&rdquo; volunteered one of the
      newcomers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd just pulled off a job in Oakdale an' had his pockets bulgin' wid
      sparklers an' kale. We was follerin' him an' when we seen your light up
      here we t'ought it was him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid shrank closer to Bridge. At last he recognized the voice
      of the speaker. While he had known that the two were of The Sky Pilot's
      band he had not been sure of the identity of either; but now it was borne
      in upon him that at least one of them was the last person on earth he
      cared to be cooped up in a small, unlighted room with, and a moment later
      when one of the two rolled a 'smoke' and lighted it he saw in the flare of
      the flame the features of both Dopey Charlie and The General. The
      Oskaloosa Kid gasped once more for the thousandth time that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been Dopey Charlie who lighted the cigaret and in the brief
      illumination his friend The General had grasped the opportunity to scan
      the features of the other members of the party. Schooled by long years of
      repression he betrayed none of the surprise or elation he felt when he
      recognized the features of The Oskaloosa Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      If The General was elated The Oskaloosa Kid was at once relieved and
      terrified. Relieved by ocular proof that he was not a murderer and
      terrified by the immediate presence of the two who had sought his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cigaret drawing well Dopey Charlie resumed: &ldquo;This Oskaloosa Kid's a
      bad actor,&rdquo; he volunteered. &ldquo;The little shrimp tried to croak me; but he
      only creased my ribs. I'd like to lay my mits on him. I'll bet there won't
      be no more Oskaloosa Kid when I get done wit him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy drew Bridge's ear down toward his own lips. &ldquo;Let's go,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I don't hear anything more downstairs, or maybe we could get out on this
      roof and slide down the porch pillars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge laid a strong, warm hand on the small, cold one of his new friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry, Kid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two other men turned quickly in the direction of the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is de Kid here?&rdquo; asked Dopey Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, my degenerate friend,&rdquo; replied Bridge; &ldquo;and furthermore he's going
      to stay here and be perfectly safe. Do you grasp me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked The General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a long story,&rdquo; replied Bridge; &ldquo;but if you chance to recall Dink
      and Crumb you may also be able to visualize one Billy Burke and Billy
      Byrne and his side partner, Bridge. Yes? Well, I am the side partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the yeggman could make reply the girl spoke up quickly. &ldquo;This man
      cannot be The Oskaloosa Kid,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was The Oskaloosa Kid who
      threw me from the car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know he ain't?&rdquo; queried The General. &ldquo;Youse was knocked out
      when these guys picks you up. It's so dark in here you couldn't reco'nize
      no one. How do you know this here bird ain't The Oskaloosa Kid, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard both these men speak,&rdquo; replied the girl; &ldquo;their voices were
      not those of any men I have known. If one of them is The Oskaloosa Kid
      then there must be two men called that. Strike a match and you will see
      that you are mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General fumbled in an inside pocket for a package of matches carefully
      wrapped against possible damage by rain. Presently he struck one and held
      the light in the direction of The Kid's face while he and the girl and
      Dopey Charlie leaned forward to scrutinize the youth's features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's him all right,&rdquo; said Dopey Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet it is,&rdquo; seconded The General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why he's only a boy,&rdquo; ejaculated the girl. &ldquo;The one who threw me from the
      machine was a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this one said he was The Oskaloosa Kid,&rdquo; persisted The General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' he shot me up,&rdquo; growled Dopey Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad he didn't kill you,&rdquo; remarked Bridge pleasantly. &ldquo;You're a
      thief and probably a murderer into the bargain&mdash;you tried to kill
      this boy just before he shot you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well wot's he?&rdquo; demanded Dopey Charlie. &ldquo;He's a thief&mdash;he said he
      was&mdash;look in his pockets&mdash;they're crammed wid swag, an' he's a
      gun-man, too, or he wouldn't be packin' a gat. I guess he ain't got
      nothin' on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The darkness hid the scarlet flush which mounted to the boy's cheeks&mdash;so
      hot that he thought it must surely glow redly through the night. He waited
      in dumb misery for Bridge to demand the proof of his guilt. Earlier in the
      evening he had flaunted the evidence of his crime in the faces of the six
      hobos; but now he suddenly felt a great shame that his new found friend
      should believe him a house-breaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bridge did not ask for any substantiation of Charlie's charges, he
      merely warned the two yeggmen that they would have to leave the boy alone
      and in the morning, when the storm had passed and daylight had lessened
      the unknown danger which lurked below-stairs, betake themselves upon their
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And while we're here together in this room you two must sit over near the
      window,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;You've tried to kill the boy once to-night; but
      you're not going to try it again&mdash;I'm taking care of him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gotta crust, bo,&rdquo; observed Dopey Charlie, belligerently. &ldquo;I guess me
      an' The General'll sit where we damn please, an' youse can take it from me
      on the side that we're goin' to have ours out of The Kid's haul. If you
      tink you're goin' to cop the whole cheese you got another tink comin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are banking,&rdquo; replied Bridge, &ldquo;on the well known fact that I never
      carry a gun; but you fail to perceive, owing to the Stygian gloom which
      surrounds us, that I have the Kid's automatic in my gun hand and that the
      business end of it is carefully aiming in your direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheese it,&rdquo; The General advised his companion; and the two removed
      themselves to the opposite side of the apartment, where they whispered,
      grumblingly, to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, the boy, and Bridge waited as patiently as they could for the
      coming of the dawn, talking of the events of the night and planning
      against the future. Bridge advised the girl to return at once to her
      father; but this she resolutely refused to do, admitting with utmost
      candor that she lacked the courage to face her friends even though her
      father might still believe in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth begged that he might accompany Bridge upon the road, pleading
      that his mother was dead and that he could not return home after his
      escapade. And Bridge could not find it in his heart to refuse him, for the
      man realized that the boyish waif possessed a subtile attraction, as
      forceful as it was inexplicable. Not since he had followed the open road
      in company with Billy Byrne had Bridge met one with whom he might care to
      'Pal' before The Kid crossed his path on the dark and storm swept pike
      south of Oakdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Byrne, mucker, pugilist, and MAN, Bridge had found a physical and moral
      counterpart of himself, for the slender Bridge was muscled as a Greek god,
      while the stocky Byrne, metamorphosed by the fire of a woman's love,
      possessed all the chivalry of the care free tramp whose vagabondage had
      never succeeded in submerging the evidences of his cultural birthright.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the youth Bridge found an intellectual equal with the added charm of a
      physical dependent. The man did not attempt to fathom the evident appeal
      of the other's tacitly acknowledged cowardice; he merely knew that he
      would not have had the youth otherwise if he could have changed him.
      Ordinarily he accepted male cowardice with the resignation of surfeited
      disgust; but in the case of The Oskaloosa Kid he realized a certain
      artless charm which but tended to strengthen his liking for the youth, so
      brazen and unaffected was the boy's admission of his terror of both the
      real and the unreal menaces of this night of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the girl also was well bred was quite evident to Bridge, while both
      the girl and the youth realized the refinement of the strange companion
      and protector which Fate had ordered for them, while they also saw in one
      another social counterparts of themselves. Thus, as the night dragged its
      slow course, the three came to trust each other more entirely and to
      speculate upon the strange train of circumstances which had brought them
      thus remarkably together&mdash;the thief, the murderer's accomplice, and
      the vagabond.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during a period of thoughtful silence when the night was darkest
      just before the dawn and the rain had settled to a dismal drizzle
      unrelieved by lightning or by thunder that the five occupants of the room
      were suddenly startled by a strange pattering sound from the floor below.
      It was as the questioning fall of a child's feet upon the uncarpeted
      boards in the room beneath them. Frozen to silent rigidity, the five sat
      straining every faculty to catch the minutest sound from the black void
      where the dead man lay, and as they listened there came up to them,
      mingled with the inexplicable footsteps, the hollow reverberation from the
      dank cellar&mdash;the hideous dragging of the chain behind the nameless
      horror which had haunted them through the interminable eons of the ghastly
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up, up, up it came toward the first floor. The pattering of the feet
      ceased. The clanking rose until the five heard the scraping of the chain
      against the door frame at the head of the cellar stairs. They heard it
      pass across the floor toward the center of the room and then, loud and
      piercing, there rang out against the silence of the awful night a woman's
      shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Bridge leaped to his feet. Without a word he tore the bed from
      before the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; cried the girl in a muffled scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going down to that woman,&rdquo; said Bridge, and he drew the bolt, rusty
      and complaining, from its corroded seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; screamed the girl, and seconding her the youth sprang to his feet
      and threw his arms about Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! Please!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Oh, please don't leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl also ran to the man's side and clutched him by the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Oh, for God's sake, don't leave us here alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard a woman scream, didn't you?&rdquo; asked Bridge. &ldquo;Do you suppose I
      can stay in up here when a woman may be facing death a few feet below me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer the girl but held more tightly to his arm while the youth
      slipped to the floor and embraced the man's knees in a vice-like hold
      which he could not break without hurting his detainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! Come!&rdquo; expostulated Bridge. &ldquo;Let me go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; begged the girl. &ldquo;Wait until you know that it is a human voice
      that screams through this horrible place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth only strained his hold tighter about the man's legs. Bridge felt
      a soft cheek pressed to his knee; and, for some unaccountable reason, the
      appeal was stronger than the pleading of the girl. Slowly Bridge realized
      that he could not leave this defenseless youth alone even though a dozen
      women might be menaced by the uncanny death below. With a firm hand he
      shot the bolt. &ldquo;Leave go of me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I shan't leave you unless she
      calls for help in articulate words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy rose and, trembling, pressed close to the man who, involuntarily,
      threw a protecting arm about the slim figure. The girl, too, drew nearer,
      while the two yeggmen rose and stood in rigid silence by the window. From
      below came an occasional rattle of the chain, followed after a few minutes
      by the now familiar clanking as the iron links scraped across the
      flooring. Mingled with the sound of the chain there rose to them what
      might have been the slow and ponderous footsteps of a heavy man, dragging
      painfully across the floor. For a few moments they heard it, and then all
      was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a dozen tense minutes the five listened; but there was no repetition
      of any sound from below. Suddenly the girl breathed a deep sigh, and the
      spell of terror was broken. Bridge felt rather than heard the youth
      sobbing softly against his breast, while across the room The General gave
      a quick, nervous laugh which he as immediately suppressed as though
      fearful unnecessarily of calling attention to their presence. The other
      vagabond fumbled with his hypodermic needle and the narcotic which would
      quickly give his fluttering nerves the quiet they craved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge, the boy, and the girl shivered together in their soggy clothing
      upon the edge of the bed, feeling now in the cold dawn the chill
      discomfort of which the excitement of the earlier hours of the night had
      rendered them unconscious. The youth coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've caught cold,&rdquo; said Bridge, his tone almost self-reproachful, as
      though he were entirely responsible for the boy's condition. &ldquo;We're a nice
      aggregation of mollycoddles&mdash;five of us sitting half frozen up here
      with a stove on the floor below, and just because we heard a noise which
      we couldn't explain and hadn't the nerve to investigate.&rdquo; He rose. &ldquo;I'm
      going down, rustle some wood and build a fire in that stove&mdash;you two
      kids have got to dry those clothes of yours and get warmed up or we'll
      have a couple of hospital cases on our hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again rose a chorus of pleas and objections. Oh, wouldn't he wait
      until daylight? See! the dawn was even then commencing to break. They
      didn't dare go down and they begged him not to leave them up there alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Dopey Charlie spoke up. The 'hop' had commenced to assert its
      dominion over his shattered nervous system instilling within him a new
      courage and a feeling of utter well-being. &ldquo;Go on down,&rdquo; said he to
      Bridge. &ldquo;The General an' I'll look after the kids&mdash;won't we bo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; assented The General; &ldquo;we'll take care of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what we'll do,&rdquo; said Bridge; &ldquo;we'll leave the kids up here
      and we three'll go down. They won't go, and I wouldn't leave them up here
      with you two morons on a bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General and Dopey Charlie didn't know what a moron was but they felt
      quite certain from Bridge's tone of voice that a moron was not a nice
      thing, and anyway no one could have bribed them to descend into the
      darkness of the lower floor with the dead man and the grisly THING that
      prowled through the haunted chambers; so they flatly refused to budge an
      inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge saw in the gradually lighting sky the near approach of full
      daylight; so he contented himself with making the girl and the youth walk
      briskly to and fro in the hope that stimulated circulation might at least
      partially overcome the menace of the damp clothing and the chill air, and
      thus they occupied the remaining hour of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      From below came no repetition of the inexplicable noises of that night of
      terror and at last, with every object plainly discernible in the light of
      the new day, Bridge would delay no longer; but voiced his final
      determination to descend and make a fire in the old kitchen stove. Both
      the boy and the girl insisted upon accompanying him. For the first time
      each had an opportunity to study the features of his companions of the
      night. Bridge found in the girl and the youth two dark eyed, good-looking
      young people. In the girl's face was, perhaps, just a trace of weakness;
      but it was not the face of one who consorts habitually with criminals. The
      man appraised her as a pretty, small-town girl who had been led into a
      temporary escapade by the monotony of village life, and he would have
      staked his soul that she was not a bad girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy, too, looked anything other than the role he had been playing.
      Bridge smiled as he looked at the clear eyes, the oval face, and the fine,
      sensitive mouth and thought of the youth's claim to the crime battered
      sobriquet of The Oskaloosa Kid. The man wondered if the mystery of the
      clanking chain would prove as harmlessly infantile as these two whom some
      accident of hilarious fate had cast in the roles of debauchery and crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aloud, he said: &ldquo;I'll go first, and if the spook materializes you two can
      beat it back into the room.&rdquo; And to the two tramps: &ldquo;Come on, boes, we'll
      all take a look at the lower floor together, and then we'll get a good
      fire going in the kitchen and warm up a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down the hall they went, Bridge leading with the boy and girl close at his
      heels while the two yeggs brought up the rear. Their footsteps echoed
      through the deserted house; but brought forth no answering clanking from
      the cellar. The stairs creaked beneath the unaccustomed weight of so many
      bodies as they descended toward the lower floor. Near the bottom Bridge
      came to a questioning halt. The front room lay entirely within his range
      of vision, and as his eyes swept it he gave voice to a short exclamation
      of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth and the girl, shivering with cold and nervous excitement, craned
      their necks above the man's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-h-h!&rdquo; gasped The Oskaloosa Kid. &ldquo;He's gone,&rdquo; and, sure enough, the dead
      man had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge stepped quickly down the remaining steps, entered the rear room
      which had served as dining room and kitchen, inspected the two small
      bedrooms off this room, and the summer kitchen beyond. All were empty;
      then he turned and re-entering the front room bent his steps toward the
      cellar stairs. At the foot of the stairway leading to the second floor lay
      the flash lamp that the boy had dropped the night before. Bridge stooped,
      picked it up and examined it. It was uninjured and with it in his hand he
      continued toward the cellar door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked The Oskaloosa Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to solve the mystery of that infernal clanking,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going down into that dark cellar!&rdquo; It was an appeal, a
      question, and a command; and it quivered gaspingly upon the verge of
      hysteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge turned and looked into the youth's face. The man did not like
      cowardice and his eyes were stern as he turned them on the lad from whom
      during the few hours of their acquaintance he had received so many
      evidences of cowardice; but as the clear brown eyes of the boy met his the
      man's softened and he shook his head perplexedly. What was there about
      this slender stripling which so disarmed criticism?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am going down. I doubt if I shall find anything
      there; but if I do it is better to come upon it when I am looking for it
      than to have it come upon us when we are not expecting it. If there is to
      be any hunting I prefer to be hunter rather than hunted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled and placed a foot upon the cellar stairs. The youth followed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going with you,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;You think I am a coward because I am
      afraid; but there is a vast difference between cowardice and fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man made no reply as he resumed the descent of the stairs, flashing
      the rays of the lamp ahead of him; but he pondered the boy's words and
      smiled as he admitted mentally that it undoubtedly took more courage to do
      a thing in the face of fear than to do it if fear were absent. He felt a
      strange elation that this youth should choose voluntarily to share his
      danger with him, for in his roaming life Bridge had known few associates
      for whom he cared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beams of the little electric lamp, moving from side to side, revealed
      a small cellar littered with refuse and festooned with cob-webs. At one
      side tottered the remains of a series of wooden racks upon which pans of
      milk had doubtless stood to cool in a long gone, happier day. Some of the
      uprights had rotted away so that a part of the frail structure had
      collapsed to the earthen floor. A table with one leg missing and a
      crippled chair constituted the balance of the contents of the cellar and
      there was no living creature and no chain nor any other visible evidence
      of the presence which had clanked so lugubriously out of the dark depths
      during the vanished night. The boy breathed a heartfelt sigh of relief and
      Bridge laughed, not without a note of relief either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see there is nothing,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;nothing except some firewood
      which we can use to advantage. I regret that James is not here to attend
      me; but since he is not you and I will have to carry some of this stuff
      upstairs,&rdquo; and together they returned to the floor above, their arms laden
      with pieces of the dilapidated milk rack. The girl was awaiting them at
      the head of the stairs while the two tramps whispered together at the
      opposite side of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took Bridge but a moment to have a roaring fire started in the old
      stove in the kitchen, and as the warmth rolled in comforting waves about
      them the five felt for the first time in hours something akin to relief
      and well being. With the physical relaxation which the heat induced came a
      like relaxation of their tongues and temporary forgetfulness of their
      antagonisms and individual apprehensions. Bridge was the only member of
      the group whose conscience was entirely free. He was not 'wanted'
      anywhere, he had no unexpiated crimes to harry his mind, and with the
      responsibilities of the night removed he fell naturally into his old,
      carefree manner. He hazarded foolish explanations of the uncanny noises of
      the night and suggested various theories to account for the presence and
      the mysterious disappearance of the dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General, on the contrary, seriously maintained that the weird sounds
      had emanated from the ghost of the murdered man who was, unquestionably,
      none other than the long dead Squibb returned to haunt his former home,
      and that the scream had sprung from the ghostly lungs of his slain wife or
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't spend anudder night in this dump,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;for both
      them pockets full of swag The Oskaloosa Kid's packin' around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately all eyes turned upon the flushing youth. The girl and Bridge
      could not prevent their own gazes from wandering to the bulging coat
      pockets, the owner of which moved uneasily, at last shooting a look of
      defiance, not unmixed with pleading, at Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a bad one,&rdquo; interjected Dopey Charlie, a glint of cunning in his
      ordinarily glassy eyes. &ldquo;He flashes a couple o' mitsful of sparklers,
      chesty-like, and allows as how he's a regular burglar. Then he pulls a gun
      on me, as wasn't doin' nothin' to him, and 'most croaks me. It's even
      money that if anyone's been croaked in Oakdale last night they won't have
      to look far for the guy that done it. Least-wise they won't have to look
      far if he doesn't come across,&rdquo; and Dopey Charlie looked meaningly and
      steadily at the side pockets of The Oskaloosa Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Bridge, after a moment of general silence, &ldquo;that you two
      crooks had better beat it. Do you get me?&rdquo; and he looked from Dopey
      Charlie to The General and back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't go,&rdquo; said Dopey Charlie, belligerently, &ldquo;until we gets half the
      Kid's swag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go now,&rdquo; said Bridge, &ldquo;without anybody's swag,&rdquo; and he drew the boy's
      automatic from his side pocket. &ldquo;You go now and you go quick&mdash;beat
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two rose and shuffled toward the door. &ldquo;We'll get you, you colledge
      Lizzy,&rdquo; threatened Dopey Charlie, &ldquo;an' we'll get that phoney punk, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And speed the parting guest,'&rdquo; quoted Bridge, firing a shot that
      splintered the floor at the crook's feet. When the two hoboes had departed
      the others huddled again close to the stove until Bridge suggested that he
      and The Oskaloosa Kid retire to another room while the girl removed and
      dried her clothing; but she insisted that it was not wet enough to matter
      since she had been covered by a robe in the automobile until just a moment
      before she had been hurled out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, after you are warmed up,&rdquo; said Bridge, &ldquo;you can step into this
      other room while the kid and I strip and dry our things, for there's no
      question but that we are wet enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the suggestion the kid started for the door. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he insisted; &ldquo;it
      isn't worth while. I am almost dry now, and as soon as we get out on the
      road I'll be all right. I&mdash;I&mdash;I like wet clothes,&rdquo; he ended,
      lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge looked at him questioningly; but did not urge the matter. &ldquo;Very
      well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you probably know what you like; but as for me, I'm going
      to pull off every rag and get good and dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl had already quitted the room and now The Kid turned and followed
      her. Bridge shook his head. &ldquo;I'll bet the little beggar never was away
      from his mother before in his life,&rdquo; he mused; &ldquo;why the mere thought of
      undressing in front of a strange man made him turn red&mdash;and posing as
      The Oskaloosa Kid! Bless my soul; but he's a humorist&mdash;a regular,
      natural born one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge found that his clothing had dried to some extent during the night;
      so, after a brisk rub, he put on the warmed garments and though some were
      still a trifle damp he felt infinitely more comfortable than he had for
      many hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the house he came upon the girl and the youth standing in the
      sunshine of a bright, new day. They were talking together in a most
      animated manner, and as he approached wondering what the two had found of
      so great common interest he discovered that the discussion hinged upon the
      relative merits of ham and bacon as a breakfast dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my heart it is just achin',&rdquo; quoted Bridge,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;For a little bite of bacon,

     &ldquo;A hunk of bread, a little mug of brew;

        &ldquo;I'm tired of seein' scenery,

     &ldquo;Just lead me to a beanery

        &ldquo;Where there's something more than only air to

           chew.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The two looked up, smiling. &ldquo;You're a funny kind of tramp, to be quoting
      poetry,&rdquo; said The Oskaloosa Kid, &ldquo;even if it is Knibbs'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost as funny,&rdquo; replied Bridge, &ldquo;as a burglar who recognizes Knibbs
      when he hears him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid flushed. &ldquo;He wrote for us of the open road,&rdquo; he replied
      quickly. &ldquo;I don't know of any other class of men who should enjoy him
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or any other class that is less familiar with him,&rdquo; retorted Bridge; &ldquo;but
      the burning question just now is pots, not poetry&mdash;flesh pots. I'm
      hungry. I could eat a cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl pointed to an adjacent field. &ldquo;Help yourself,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That happens to be a bull,&rdquo; said Bridge. &ldquo;I was particular to mention
      cow, which, in this instance, is proverbially less dangerous than the
      male, and much better eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We kept a-rambling all the time. I rustled grub, he rustled rhyme&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Blind baggage, hoof it, ride or climb&mdash;we always put it through.'
      Who's going to rustle the grub?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked at The Oskaloosa Kid. &ldquo;You don't seem like a tramp at all,
      to talk to,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I suppose you are used to asking for food. I
      couldn't do it&mdash;I should die if I had to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid looked uncomfortable. &ldquo;So should&mdash;&rdquo; he commenced,
      and then suddenly subsided. &ldquo;Of course I'd just as soon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      two stay here&mdash;I'll be back in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They watched him as he walked down to the road and until he disappeared
      over the crest of the hill a short distance from the Squibbs' house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him,&rdquo; said the girl, turning toward Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be some good in him,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;even if he is such a
      desperate character; but I know he's not The Oskaloosa Kid. Do you really
      suppose he robbed a house last night and then tried to kill that Dopey
      person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge shook his head. &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I am inclined to
      believe that he is more imaginative than criminal. He certainly shot up
      the Dopey person; but I doubt if he ever robbed a house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they waited, The Oskaloosa Kid trudged along the muddy road to the
      nearest farm house, which lay a full mile beyond the Squibbs' home. As he
      approached the door a lank, sallow man confronted him with a suspicious
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; greeted The Oskaloosa Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to get something to eat,&rdquo; explained the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the boy had hurled a dynamite bomb at him the result could have been no
      more surprising. The lank, sallow man went up into the air, figuratively.
      He went up a mile or more, and on the way down he reached his hand inside
      the kitchen door and brought it forth enveloping the barrel of a shot gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Durn ye!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I'll lam ye! Get offen here. I knows ye. Yer one o'
      that gang o' bums that come here last night, an' now you got the gall to
      come back beggin' for food, eh? I'll lam ye!&rdquo; and he raised the gun to his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid quailed but he held his ground. &ldquo;I wasn't here last
      night,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and I'm not begging for food&mdash;I want to buy some.
      I've got plenty of money,&rdquo; in proof of which assertion he dug into a side
      pocket and brought forth a large roll of bills. The man lowered his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wy didn't ye say so in the first place then?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;How'd I know
      you wanted to buy it, eh? Where'd ye come from anyhow, this early in the
      mornin'? What's yer name, eh? What's yer business, that's what Jeb Case'd
      like to know, eh?&rdquo; He snapped his words out with the rapidity of a machine
      gun, nor waited for a reply to one query before launching the next. &ldquo;What
      do ye want to buy, eh? How much money ye got? Looks suspicious. That's a
      sight o' money yew got there, eh? Where'dje get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's mine,&rdquo; said The Oskaloosa Kid, &ldquo;and I want to buy some eggs and milk
      and ham and bacon and flour and onions and sugar and cream and
      strawberries and tea and coffee and a frying pan and a little oil stove,
      if you have one to spare, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeb Case's jaw dropped and his eyes widened. &ldquo;You're in the wrong pasture,
      bub,&rdquo; he remarked feelingly. &ldquo;What yer lookin' fer is Sears, Roebuck &amp;
      Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid flushed up to the tips of his ears. &ldquo;But can't you sell
      me something?&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might let ye have some milk an' eggs an' butter an' a leetle bacon an'
      mebby my ol' woman's got a loaf left from her last bakin'; but we ain't
      been figgerin' on supplyin' grub fer the United States army ef that's what
      yew be buyin' fer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A frowsy, rat-faced woman and a gawky youth of fourteen stuck their heads
      out the doorway at either side of the man. &ldquo;I ain't got nothin' to sell,&rdquo;
       snapped the woman; but as she spoke her eyes fell upon the fat bank roll
      in the youth's hand. &ldquo;Or, leastwise,&rdquo; she amended, &ldquo;I ain't got much
      more'n we need an' the price o' stuff's gone up so lately that I'll hev to
      ask ye more'n I would of last fall. 'Bout what did ye figger on wantin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you can spare,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;There are three of us and we're
      awful hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where yew stoppin'?&rdquo; asked the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're at the old Squibbs' place,&rdquo; replied The Kid. &ldquo;We got caught by the
      storm last night and had to put up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Squibbs' place!&rdquo; ejaculated the woman. &ldquo;Yew didn't stop there over
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes we did,&rdquo; replied the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See anything funny?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn't SEE anything,&rdquo; replied The Oskaloosa Kid; &ldquo;but we heard things.
      At least we didn't see what we heard; but we saw a dead man on the floor
      when we went in and this morning he was gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cases shuddered. &ldquo;A dead man!&rdquo; ejaculated Jeb Case. &ldquo;Yew seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Kid nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never tuk much stock in them stories,&rdquo; said Jeb, with a shake of his
      head; &ldquo;but ef you SEEN it! Gosh! Thet beats me. Come on M'randy, les see
      what we got to spare,&rdquo; and he turned into the kitchen with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lanky boy stepped out, and planting himself in front of The Oskaloosa
      Kid proceeded to stare at him. &ldquo;Yew seen it?&rdquo; he asked in awestruck tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Kid in a low voice, and bending close toward the other;
      &ldquo;it had bloody froth on its lips!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Case boy shrank back. &ldquo;An' what did yew hear?&rdquo; he asked, a glutton for
      thrills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something that dragged a chain behind it and came up out of the cellar
      and tried to get in our room on the second floor,&rdquo; explained the youth.
      &ldquo;It almost got us, too,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and it did it all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew,&rdquo; whistled the Case boy. &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; Then he scratched his head and
      looked admiringly at the youth. &ldquo;What mought yer name be?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm The Oskaloosa Kid,&rdquo; replied the youth, unable to resist the
      admiration of the other's fond gaze. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; and he fished a handful
      of jewelry from one of his side pockets; &ldquo;this is some of the swag I stole
      last night when I robbed a house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Case Jr. opened his mouth and eyes so wide that there was little left of
      his face. &ldquo;But that's nothing,&rdquo; bragged The Kid. &ldquo;I shot a man, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night?&rdquo; whispered the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; replied the bad man, tersely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; said the young Mr. Case, but there was that in his facial
      expression which brought to The Oskaloosa Kid a sudden regret that he had
      thus rashly confided in a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said The Kid, after a moment's strained silence. &ldquo;Don't tell
      anyone, will you? If you'll promise I'll give you a dollar,&rdquo; and he hunted
      through his roll of bills for one of that lowly denomination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed the Case boy. &ldquo;I won't say a word&mdash;where's the
      dollar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth drew a bill from his roll and handed it to the other. &ldquo;If you
      tell,&rdquo; he whispered, and he bent close toward the other's ear and spoke in
      a menacing tone; &ldquo;If you tell, I'll kill you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; said Willie Case.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Case pere and mere emerged from the kitchen loaded with
      provender. &ldquo;Here's enough an' more'n enough, I reckon,&rdquo; said Jeb Case. &ldquo;We
      got eggs, butter, bread, bacon, milk, an' a mite o' garden sass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we ain't goin' to charge you nothin' fer the garden sass,&rdquo;
       interjected Mrs. Case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's awfully nice of you,&rdquo; replied The Kid. &ldquo;How much do I owe you for
      the rest of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Jeb Case, rubbing his chin, eyeing the big roll of bills and
      wondering just the limit he might raise to, &ldquo;I reckon 'bout four dollars
      an' six bits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid peeled a five dollar bill from his roll and proffered it
      to the farmer. &ldquo;I'm ever so much obliged,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you needn't mind
      about any change. I thank you so much.&rdquo; With which he took the several
      packages and pails and turned toward the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yew gotta return them pails!&rdquo; shouted Mrs. Case after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; replied The Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Case, feelingly. &ldquo;I wisht I'd asked six bits more&mdash;I
      mought jest as well o' got it as not. Gosh, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; murmured Willie Case, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back down the sticky road plodded The Oskaloosa Kid, his arms heavy and
      his heart light, for, was he not 'bringing home the bacon,' literally as
      well as figuratively. As he entered the Squibbs' gateway he saw the girl
      and Bridge standing upon the verandah waiting his coming, and as he
      approached them and they caught a nearer view of his great burden of
      provisions they hailed him with loud acclaim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some artist!&rdquo; cried the man. &ldquo;And to think that I doubted your ability to
      make a successful touch! Forgive me! You are the ne plus ultra, non est
      cumquidibus, in hoc signo vinces, only and original kind of hand-out
      compellers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the world did you do it?&rdquo; asked the girl, rapturously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's easy when you know how,&rdquo; replied The Oskaloosa Kid carelessly,
      as, with the help of the others, he carried the fruits of his expedition
      into the kitchen. Here Bridge busied himself about the stove, adding more
      wood to the fire and scrubbing a portion of the top plate as clean as he
      could get it with such crude means as he could discover about the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth he sent to the nearby brook for water after selecting the least
      dirty of the several empty tin cans lying about the floor of the summer
      kitchen. He warned against the use of the water from the old well and
      while the boy was away cut a generous portion of the bacon into long, thin
      strips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after, the water coming to the boil, Bridge lowered three eggs
      into it, glanced at his watch, greased one of the new cleaned stove lids
      with a piece of bacon rind and laid out as many strips of bacon as the lid
      would accommodate. Instantly the room was filled with the delicious odor
      of frying bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-m-m-m!&rdquo; gloated The Oskaloosa Kid. &ldquo;I wish I had bo&mdash;asked for
      more. My! but I never smelled anything so good as that in all my life. Are
      you going to boil only three eggs? I could eat a dozen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The can'll only hold three at a time,&rdquo; explained Bridge. &ldquo;We'll have some
      more boiling while we are eating these.&rdquo; He borrowed his knife from the
      girl, who was slicing and buttering bread with it, and turned the bacon
      swiftly and deftly with the point, then he glanced at his watch. &ldquo;The
      three minutes are up,&rdquo; he announced and, with a couple of small, flat
      sticks saved for the purpose from the kindling wood, withdrew the eggs one
      at a time from the can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have no cups!&rdquo; exclaimed The Oskaloosa Kid, in sudden despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge laughed. &ldquo;Knock an end off your egg and the shell will answer in
      place of a cup. Got a knife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Kid didn't. Bridge eyed him quizzically. &ldquo;You must have done most of
      your burgling near home,&rdquo; he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a burglar!&rdquo; cried the youth indignantly. Somehow it was very
      different when this nice voiced man called him a burglar from bragging of
      the fact himself to such as The Sky Pilot's villainous company, or the
      awestruck, open-mouthed Willie Case whose very expression invited heroics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge made no reply, but his eyes wandered to the right hand side pocket
      of the boy's coat. Instantly the latter glanced guiltily downward to flush
      redly at the sight of several inches of pearl necklace protruding
      accusingly therefrom. The girl, a silent witness of the occurrence, was
      brought suddenly and painfully to a realization of her present position
      and recollection of the happenings of the preceding night. For the time
      she had forgotten that she was alone in the company of a tramp and a
      burglar&mdash;how much worse either might be she could only guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast, commenced so auspiciously, continued in gloomy silence. At
      least the girl and The Oskaloosa Kid were silent and gloom steeped. Bridge
      was thoughtful but far from morose. His spirits were unquenchable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I shall have to replace James. His defection
      is unforgivable, and he has misplaced the finger-bowls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth and the girl forced wan smiles; but neither spoke. Bridge drew a
      pouch of tobacco and some papers from an inside pocket.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;'I had the makings and I smoked

           &ldquo;'And wondered over different things,

        &ldquo;'Thinkin' as how this old world joked

           &ldquo;'In callin' only some men kings

        &ldquo;'While I sat there a-blowin' rings.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He paused to kindle a sliver of wood at the stove. &ldquo;In these parlous
      times,&rdquo; he spoke as though to himself, &ldquo;one must economize. They are
      taking a quarter of an ounce out of each five cents worth of chewing, I am
      told; so doubtless each box must be five or six matches short of full
      count. Even these papers seem thinner than of yore and they will only sell
      one book to a customer at that. Indeed Sherman was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth and the girl remained occupied with their own thoughts, and
      after a moment's silence the vagabond resumed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;'Me? I was king of anywhere,

         &ldquo;'Peggin' away at nothing, hard.

      &ldquo;'Havin' no pet, particular care;

         &ldquo;'Havin' no trouble, or no pard;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'"Just me,&rdquo; filled up my callin' card.' &ldquo;Say, do you know I've learned to
      love this Knibbs person. I used to think of him as a poor attic prune
      grinding away in his New York sky parlor, writing his verse of the things
      he longed for but had never known; until, one day, I met a fellow between
      Victorville and Cajon pass who knew His Knibbs, and come to find out this
      Knibbs is a regular fellow. His attic covers all God's country that is out
      of doors and he knows the road from La Bajada hill to Barstow a darned
      sight better than he knows Broadway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answering sympathy awakened in either of his listeners&mdash;they
      remained mute. Bridge rose and stretched. He picked up his knife, wiped
      off the blade, closed it and slipped it into a trousers' pocket. Then he
      walked toward the door. At the threshold he paused and turned. &ldquo;'Good-bye
      girls! I'm through,'&rdquo; he quoted and passed out into the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the two within were on their feet and following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; cried The Oskaloosa Kid. &ldquo;You're not going to leave
      us, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please don't!&rdquo; pleaded the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Bridge, solemnly, &ldquo;whether I'm safe in remaining in
      your society or not. This Oskaloosa Kid is a bad proposition; and as for
      you, young lady, I rather imagine that the town constable is looking for
      you right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl winced. &ldquo;Please don't,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;I haven't done anything
      wicked, honestly! But I want to get away so that they can't question me. I
      was in the car when they killed him; but I had nothing to do with it. It
      is just because of my father that I don't want them to find me. It would
      break his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the three stood back of the Squibbs' summer kitchen Fate, in the guise
      of a rural free delivery carrier and a Ford, passed by the front gate. A
      mile beyond he stopped at the Case mail box where Jeb and his son Willie
      were, as usual, waiting his coming, for the rural free delivery man often
      carries more news than is contained in his mail sacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mornin' Jeb,&rdquo; he called, as he swerved his light car from the road and
      drew up in front of the Case gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mornin', Jim!&rdquo; returned Mr. Case. &ldquo;Nice rain we had last night. What's
      the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty! Plenty!&rdquo; exclaimed the carrier. &ldquo;Lived here nigh onto forty year,
      man an' boy, an' never seen such work before in all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo; questioned the farmer, scenting something interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ol' man Baggs's murdered last night,&rdquo; announced the carrier, watching
      eagerly for the effect of his announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; gasped Willie Case. &ldquo;Was he shot?&rdquo; It was almost a scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;He's up to the horspital now, an' the doc says he
      haint one chance in a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But thet ain't all,&rdquo; continued Jim. &ldquo;Reggie Paynter was murdered last
      night, too; right on the pike south of town. They threw his corpse outen a
      ottymobile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gol!&rdquo; cried Jeb Case; &ldquo;I hearn them devils go by last night 'bout
      midnight er after. 'T woke me up. They must o' ben goin' sixty mile an
      hour. Er say,&rdquo; he stopped to scratch his head. &ldquo;Mebby it was tramps. They
      must a ben a score on 'em round here yesterday and las' night an' agin
      this mornin'. I never seed so dum many bums in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' thet ain't all,&rdquo; went on the carrier, ignoring the other's comments.
      &ldquo;Oakdale's all tore up. Abbie Prim's disappeared and Jonas Prim's house
      was robbed jest about the same time Ol' man Baggs 'uz murdered, er most
      murdered&mdash;chances is he's dead by this time anyhow. Doc said he
      hadn't no chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; It was a pater-filius duet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But thet ain't all,&rdquo; gloated Jim. &ldquo;Two of the persons in the car with
      Reggie Paynter were recognized, an' who do you think one of 'em was, eh?
      Why one of 'em was Abbie Prim an' tother was a slick crook from Toledo er
      Noo York that's called The Oskaloosie Kid. By gum, I'll bet they get 'em
      in no time. Why already Jonas Prim's got a regular dee-dectiff down from
      Chicago, an' the board o' select-men's offered a re-ward o' fifty dollars
      fer the arrest an' conviction of the perpetrators of these dastardly
      crimes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; cried Willie Case. &ldquo;I know&mdash;&ldquo;; but then he paused. If he told
      all he knew he saw plainly that either the carrier or his father would
      profit by it and collect the reward. Fifty dollars!! Willie gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;I gotta be on my way. Here's the Tribune&mdash;there
      ain't nothin' more fer ye. So long! Giddap!&rdquo; and he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' see why he don't carry a whip,&rdquo; mused Jeb Case. &ldquo;A-gidappin' to
      that there tin lizzie,&rdquo; he muttered disgustedly, &ldquo;jes' like it was as good
      as a hoss. But I mind the time, the fust day he got the dinged thing, he
      gets out an' tries to lead it by Lem Smith's threshin' machine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeb Case preferred an audience worthy his mettle; but Willie was better
      than no one, yet when he turned to note the effect of his remarks on his
      son, Willie was no where to be seen. If Jeb had but known it his young
      hopeless was already in the loft of the hay barn deep in a small,
      red-covered book entitled: &ldquo;HOW TO BE A DETECTIVE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge, who had had no intention of deserting his helpless companions,
      appeared at last to yield reluctantly to their pleas. That indefinable
      something about the youth which appealed strongly to the protective
      instinct in the man, also assured him that the other's mask of criminality
      was for the most part assumed even though the stories of the two yeggmen
      and the loot bulging pockets argued to the contrary. There was the chance,
      however, that the boy had really taken the first step upon the road toward
      a criminal career, and if such were the case Bridge felt morally obligated
      to protect his new found friend from arrest, secure in the reflection that
      his own precept and example would do more to lead him back into the path
      of rectitude than would any police magistrate or penal institute.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the girl he felt a deep pity. In the past he had had knowledge of more
      than one other small-town girl led into wrong doing through the deadly
      monotony and flagrant hypocrisy of her environment. Himself highly
      imaginative and keenly sensitive, he realized with what depth of horror
      the girl anticipated a return to her home and friends after the childish
      escapade which had culminated, even through no fault of hers, in criminal
      tragedy of the most sordid sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the three held a council of war at the rear of the deserted house they
      were startled by the loud squeaking of brake bands on the road in front.
      Bridge ran quickly into the kitchen and through to the front room where he
      saw three men alighting from a large touring car which had drawn up before
      the sagging gate. As the foremost man, big and broad shouldered, raised
      his eyes to the building Bridge smothered an exclamation of surprise and
      chagrin, nor did he linger to inspect the other members of the party; but
      turned and ran quickly back to his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to beat it!&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;they've brought Burton himself down
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's Burton?&rdquo; demanded the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's the best operative west of New York City,&rdquo; replied Bridge, as he
      moved rapidly toward an outhouse directly in rear of the main building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once behind the small, dilapidated structure which had once probably
      housed farm implements, Bridge paused and looked about. &ldquo;They'll search
      here,&rdquo; he prophesied, and then; &ldquo;Those woods look good to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Squibbs' woods, growing rank in the damp ravine at the bottom of the
      little valley, ran to within a hundred feet of the out-building. Dense
      undergrowth choked the ground to a height of eight or ten feet around the
      boles of the close set trees. If they could gain the seclusion of that
      tangled jungle there was little likelihood of their being discovered,
      provided they were not seen as they passed across the open space between
      their hiding place and the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd better make a break for it,&rdquo; advised Bridge, and a moment later the
      three moved cautiously toward the wood, keeping the out-house between
      themselves and the farm house. Almost in front of them as they neared the
      wood they saw a well defined path leading into the thicket. Single-file
      they entered, to be almost instantly hidden from view, not only from the
      house but from any other point more than a dozen paces away, for the path
      was winding, narrow and closely walled by the budding verdure of the new
      Spring. Birds sang or twittered about them, the mat of dead leaves oozed
      spongily beneath their feet, giving forth no sound as they passed, save a
      faint sucking noise as a foot was lifted from each watery seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge was in the lead, moving steadily forward that they might put as
      much distance as possible between themselves and the detective should the
      latter chance to explore the wood. They had advanced a few hundred yards
      when the path crossed through a small clearing the center of which was
      destitute of fallen leaves. Here the path was beaten into soft mud and as
      Bridge came to it he stopped and bent his gaze incredulously upon the
      ground. The girl and the youth, halting upon either side, followed the
      direction of his eyes with theirs. The girl gave a little, involuntary
      gasp, and the boy grasped Bridge's hand as though fearful of losing him.
      The man turned a quizzical glance at each of them and smiled, though a bit
      ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It beats me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; whispered the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let's go back,&rdquo; begged the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And go along to father with Burton?&rdquo; asked Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl trembled and shook her head. &ldquo;I would rather die,&rdquo; she said,
      firmly. &ldquo;Come, let's go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cause of their perturbation was imprinted deeply in the mud of the
      pathway&mdash;the irregular outlines of an enormous, naked, human foot&mdash;a
      great, uncouth foot that bespoke a monster of another world. While, still
      more uncanny, in view of what they had heard in the farm house during the
      previous night, there lay, sometimes partially obliterated by the
      footprints of the THING, the impress of a small, bare foot&mdash;a woman's
      or a child's&mdash;and over both an irregular scoring that might have been
      wrought by a dragging chain!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the loft of his father's hay barn Willie Case delved deep into the
      small red-covered volume, HOW TO BE A DETECTIVE; but though he turned many
      pages and flitted to and fro from preface to conclusion he met only with
      disappointment. The pictures of noted bank burglars and confidence men
      aided him not one whit, for in none of them could he descry the slightest
      resemblance to the smooth faced youth of the early morning. In fact, so
      totally different were the types shown in the little book that Willie was
      forced to scratch his head and exclaim &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; many times in an effort to
      reconcile the appearance of the innocent boy to the hardened, criminal
      faces he found portrayed upon the printed pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, by gol!&rdquo; he exclaimed mentally, &ldquo;he said he was The Oskaloosie Kid,
      'n' that he shot a man last night; but what I'd like to know is how I'm
      goin' to shadder him from this here book. Here it says: 'If the criminal
      gets on a street car and then jumps off at the next corner the good
      detective will know that his man is aware that he is being shadowed, and
      will stay on the car and telephone his office at the first opportunity.'
      'N'ere it sez: 'If your man gets into a carriage don't run up an' jump on
      the back of it; but simply hire another carriage and follow.' How in hek
      kin I foller this book?&rdquo; wailed Willie. &ldquo;They ain't no street cars 'round
      here. I ain't never seen a street car, 'n'as fer a carriage, I reckon he
      means bus, they's only one on 'em in Oakdale 'n'if they waz forty I'd like
      to know how in hek I'd hire one when I ain't got no money. I reckon I
      threw away my four-bits on this book&mdash;it don't tell a feller nothin'
      'bout false whiskers, wigs 'n' the like,&rdquo; and he tossed the book
      disgustedly into a corner, rose and descended to the barnyard. Here he
      busied himself about some task that should have been attended to a week
      before, and which even now was not destined to be completed that day,
      since Willie had no more than set himself to it than his attention was
      distracted by the sudden appearance of a touring car being brought to a
      stop in front of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Willie dropped his irksome labor and slouched lazily toward the
      machine, the occupants of which were descending and heading for the Case
      front door. Jeb Case met them before they reached the porch and Willie
      lolled against a pillar listening eagerly to all that was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most imposing figure among the strangers was the same whom Bridge had
      seen approaching the Squibbs' house a short time before. It was he who
      acted as spokesman for the newcomers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you may know,&rdquo; he said, after introducing himself, &ldquo;a number of crimes
      were committed in and around Oakdale last night. We are searching for
      clews to the perpetrators, some of whom must still be in the neighborhood.
      Have you seen any strange or suspicious characters around lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say we hed,&rdquo; exclaimed Jeb emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seen the wo'st lookin' gang o' bums come outen my hay barn this mornin'
      thet I ever seed in my life. They must o' ben upward of a dozen on 'em.
      They waz makin' fer the house when I steps in an' grabs my ol' shot gun. I
      hollered at 'em not to come a step nigher 'n' I guess they seed it wa'n't
      safe monkeyin' with me; so they skidaddled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way did they go?&rdquo; asked Burton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off down the road yonder; but I don't know which way they turned at the
      crossin's, er ef they kept straight on toward Millsville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burton asked a number of questions in an effort to fix the identity of
      some of the gang, warned Jeb to telephone him at Jonas Prim's if he saw
      anything further of the strangers, and then retraced his steps toward the
      car. Not once had Jeb mentioned the youth who had purchased supplies from
      him that morning, and the reason was that Jeb had not considered the young
      man of sufficient importance, having cataloged him mentally as an
      unusually early specimen of the summer camper with which he was more or
      less familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willie, on the contrary, realized the importance of their morning
      customer, yet just how he was to cash in on his knowledge was not yet
      entirely clear. He was already convinced that HOW TO BE A DETECTIVE would
      help him not at all, and with the natural suspicion of ignorance he feared
      to divulge his knowledge to the city detective for fear that the latter
      would find the means to cheat him out of the princely reward offered by
      the Oakdale village board. He thought of going at once to the Squibbs'
      house and placing the desperate criminals under arrest; but as fear
      throttled the idea in its infancy he cast about for some other plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as he stood there thinking the great detective and his companions
      were entering the automobile to drive away. In a moment they would be
      gone. Were they not, after all, the very men, the only men, in fact, to
      assist him in his dilemma? At least he could test them out. If necessary
      he would divide the reward with them! Running toward the road Willie
      shouted to the departing sleuth. The car, moving slowly forward in low,
      came again to rest. Willie leaped to the running board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I tell you where the murderer is,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;do I git
      the $50.00?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Detective Burton was too old a hand to ignore even the most seemingly
      impossible of aids. He laid a kindly hand on Willie's shoulder. &ldquo;You bet
      you do,&rdquo; he replied heartily, &ldquo;and what's more I'll add another fifty to
      it. What do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seen the murderer this mornin',&rdquo; Willie was gasping with excitement and
      elation. Already the one hundred dollars was as good as his. One hundred
      dollars! Willie &ldquo;Goshed!&rdquo; mentally even as he told his tale. &ldquo;He come to
      our house an' bought some vittles an' stuff. Paw didn't know who he wuz;
      but when Paw went inside he told me he was The Oskaloosie Kid 'n' thet he
      robbed a house last night and killed a man, 'n' he had a whole pocket full
      o' money, 'n' he said he'd kill me ef I told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Detective Burton could scarce restrain a smile as he listened to this
      wildly improbable tale, yet his professional instinct was too keen to
      permit him to cast aside as worthless the faintest evidence until he had
      proven it to be worthless. He stepped from the car again and motioning to
      Willie to follow him returned to the Case yard where Jeb was already
      coming toward the gate, having noted the interest which his son was
      arousing among the occupants of the car. Willie pulled at the detective's
      sleeve. &ldquo;Don't tell Paw about the reward,&rdquo; he begged; &ldquo;he'll keep it all
      hisself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burton reassured the boy with a smile and a nod, and then as he neared Jeb
      he asked him if a young man had been at his place that morning asking for
      food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Jeb; &ldquo;but he didn't 'mount to nothin'. One o' these here
      summer camper pests. He paid fer all he got. Had a roll o' bills 's big as
      ye fist. Little feller he were, not much older 'n' Willie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know that he told your son that he was The Oskaloosa Kid and that
      he had robbed a house and killed a man last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; exclaimed Jeb. Then he turned and cast one awful look at Willie&mdash;a
      look large with menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest, Paw,&rdquo; pleaded the boy. &ldquo;I was a-scairt to tell you, 'cause he
      said he'd kill me ef I told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeb scratched his head. &ldquo;Yew know what you'll get ef you're lyin' to me,&rdquo;
       he threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he's telling the truth,&rdquo; said detective Burton. &ldquo;Where is the
      man now?&rdquo; he asked Willie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down to the Squibbs' place,&rdquo; and Willie jerked a dirty thumb toward the
      east.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said Burton; &ldquo;we just came from there; but there has been
      someone there this morning, for there is still a fire in the kitchen
      range. Does anyone live there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; said Willie emphatically; &ldquo;the place is haunted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thet's right,&rdquo; interjected Jeb. &ldquo;Thet's what they do say, an' this here
      Oskaloosie Kid said they heered things las' night an' seed a dead man on
      the floor, didn't he M'randy?&rdquo; M'randy nodded her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't take no stock in what Willie's ben tellin' ye,&rdquo; she
      continued, &ldquo;'n' ef his paw don't lick him I will. I told him tell I'm good
      an' tired o' talkin' thet one liar 'round a place wuz all I could stand,&rdquo;
       and she cast a meaning glance at her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest, Maw, I ain't a-lyin',&rdquo; insisted Willie. &ldquo;Wot do you suppose he
      give me this fer, if it wasn't to keep me from talkin',&rdquo; and the boy drew
      a crumpled one dollar bill from his pocket. It was worth the dollar to
      escape a thrashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He give you thet?&rdquo; asked his mother. Willie nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'N' thet ain't all he had neither,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Beside all them bills he
      showed me a whole pocket full o' jewlry, 'n' he had a string o' things
      thet I don't know jest what you call 'em; but they looked like they was
      made outen the inside o' clam shells only they was all round like
      marbles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Detective Burton raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;Miss Prim's pearl necklace,&rdquo; he
      commented to the man at his side. The other nodded. &ldquo;Don't punish your
      son, Mrs. Case,&rdquo; he said to the woman. &ldquo;I believe he has discovered a
      great deal that will help us in locating the man we want. Of course I am
      interested principally in finding Miss Prim&mdash;her father has engaged
      me for that purpose; but I think the arrest of the perpetrators of any of
      last night's crimes will put us well along on the trail of the missing
      young lady, as it is almost a foregone conclusion that there is a
      connection between her disappearance and some of the occurrences which
      have so excited Oakdale. I do not mean that she was a party to any
      criminal act; but it is more than possible that she was abducted by the
      same men who later committed the other crimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Cases hung open-mouthed upon his words, while his companions wondered
      at the loquaciousness of this ordinarily close-mouthed man, who, as a
      matter of fact, was but attempting to win the confidence of the boy on the
      chance that even now he had not told all that he knew; but Willie had told
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding, after a few minutes further conversation, that he could glean no
      additional information the detective returned to his car and drove west
      toward Millsville on the assumption that the fugitives would seek escape
      by the railway running through that village. Only thus could he account
      for their turning off the main pike. The latter was now well guarded all
      the way to Payson; while the Millsville road was still open.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had he departed than Willie Case disappeared, nor did he answer
      at noon to the repeated ringing of the big, farm dinner bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half way between the Case farm and Millsville detective Burton saw, far
      ahead along the road, two figures scale a fence and disappear behind the
      fringing blackberry bushes which grew in tangled profusion on either side.
      When they came abreast of the spot he ordered the driver to stop; but
      though he scanned the open field carefully he saw no sign of living thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two men hiding behind those bushes,&rdquo; he said to his companions
      in a low whisper. &ldquo;One of you walk ahead about fifty yards and the other
      go back the same distance and then climb the fence. When I see you getting
      over I'll climb it here. They can't get away from us.&rdquo; To the driver he
      said: &ldquo;You have a gun. If they make a break go after 'em. You can shoot if
      they don't stop when you tell 'em to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men walked in opposite directions along the road, and when Burton
      saw them turn in and start to climb the fence he vaulted over the panel
      directly opposite the car. He had scarcely alighted upon the other side
      when his eyes fell upon the disreputable figures of two tramps stretched
      out upon their backs and snoring audibly. Burton grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two sure can go to sleep in a hurry,&rdquo; he said. One of the men opened
      his eyes and sat up. When he saw who it was that stood over him he grinned
      sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't a guy lie down fer a minute in de bushes widout bein' pinched?&rdquo; he
      asked. The other man now sat up and viewed the newcomer, while from either
      side Burton's companions closed in on the three.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot's de noise?&rdquo; inquired the second tramp, looking from one to another
      of the intruders. &ldquo;We ain't done nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, Charlie,&rdquo; Burton assured him gaily. &ldquo;Who would ever
      suspect that you or The General would do anything; but somebody did
      something in Oakdale last night and I want to take you back there and have
      a nice, long talk with you. Put your hands up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put 'em up!&rdquo; snapped Burton, and when the four grimy fists had been
      elevated he signalled to his companions to search the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more formidable than knives, dope, and a needle were found upon
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; drawled Dopey Charlie. &ldquo;We knows wot we knows; but hones' to gawd
      we didn't have nothin' to do wid it. We knows the guy that pulled it off&mdash;we
      spent las' night wid him an' his pal an' a skoit. He creased me, here,&rdquo;
       and Charlie unbuttoned his clothing and exposed to view the bloody scratch
      of The Oskaloosa Kid's bullet. &ldquo;On de level, Burton, we wern't in on it.
      Dis guy was at dat Squibbs' place wen we pulls in dere outen de rain. He
      has a pocket full o' kale an' sparklers an' tings, and he goes fer to
      shoot me up wen I tries to get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo; asked Burton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called hisself de Oskaloosa Kid,&rdquo; replied Charlie. &ldquo;A guy called
      Bridge was wid him. You know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard of him; but he's straight,&rdquo; replied Burton. &ldquo;Who was the
      skirt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Charlie; &ldquo;but she was gassin' 'bout her pals croakin' a
      guy an' turnin' 'im outten a gas wagon, an' dis Oskaloosa Kid he croaks
      some old guy in Oakdale las' night. Mebby he ain't a bad 'un though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo; asked Burton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We got away from 'em at the Squibbs' place this mornin',&rdquo; said Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Burton, &ldquo;you boes come along with me. If you ain't done
      nothing the worst you'll get'll be three squares and a place to sleep for
      a few days. I want you where I can lay my hands on you when I need a
      couple of witnesses,&rdquo; and he herded them over the fence and into the
      machine. As he himself was about to step in he felt suddenly of his breast
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; asked one of his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've lost my note book,&rdquo; replied Burton; &ldquo;it must have dropped out of my
      pocket when I jumped the fence. Just wait a minute while I go look for
      it,&rdquo; and he returned to the fence, vaulted it and disappeared behind the
      bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fully five minutes before he returned but when he did there was a
      look of satisfaction on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find it?&rdquo; asked his principal lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; replied Burton. &ldquo;I wouldn't have lost it for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge and his companions had made their way along the wooded path for
      perhaps a quarter of a mile when the man halted and drew back behind the
      foliage of a flowering bush. With raised finger he motioned the others to
      silence and then pointed through the branches ahead. The boy and the girl,
      tense with excitement, peered past the man into a clearing in which stood
      a log shack, mud plastered; but it was not the hovel which held their mute
      attention&mdash;it was rather the figure of a girl, bare headed and bare
      footed, who toiled stubbornly with an old spade at a long, narrow
      excavation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All too suggestive in itself was the shape of the hole the girl was
      digging; there was no need of the silent proof of its purpose which lay
      beside her to tell the watchers that she worked alone in the midst of the
      forest solitude upon a human grave. The thing wrapped in an old quilt lay
      silently waiting for the making of its last bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the three watched her other eyes watched them and the digging girl&mdash;wide,
      awestruck eyes, filled with a great terror, yet now and again half closing
      in the shrewd expression of cunning that is a hall mark of crafty
      ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as they watched, their over-wrought nerves suddenly shuddered to the
      grewsome clanking of a chain from the dark interior of the hovel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth, holding tight to Bridge's sleeve, strove to pull him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go back,&rdquo; he whispered in a voice that trembled so that he could
      scarce control it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; urged the girl. &ldquo;Here is another path leading toward the
      north. We must be close to a road. Let's get away from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The digger paused and raised her head, listening, as though she had caught
      the faint, whispered note of human voices. She was a black haired girl of
      nineteen or twenty, dressed in a motley of flowered calico and silk, with
      strings of gold and silver coins looped around her olive neck. Her bare
      arms were encircled by bracelets&mdash;some cheap and gaudy, others well
      wrought from gold and silver. From her ears depended ornaments fashioned
      from gold coins. Her whole appearance was barbaric, her occupation cast a
      sinister haze about her; and yet her eyes seemed fashioned for laughter
      and her lips for kissing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchers remained motionless as the girl peered first in one direction
      and then in another, seeking an explanation of the sounds which had
      disturbed her. Her brows were contracted into a scowl of apprehension
      which remained even after she returned to her labors, and that she was ill
      at ease was further evidenced by the frequent pauses she made to cast
      quick glances toward the dense tanglewood surrounding the clearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the grave was dug. The girl climbed out and stood looking down
      upon the quilt wrapped thing at her feet. For a moment she stood there as
      silent and motionless as the dead. Only the twittering of birds disturbed
      the quiet of the wood. Bridge felt a soft hand slipped into his and
      slender fingers grip his own. He turned his eyes to see the boy at his
      side gazing with wide eyes and trembling lips at the tableau within the
      clearing. Involuntarily the man's hand closed tightly upon the youth's.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as they stood thus the silence was shattered by a loud and human
      sneeze from the thicket not fifty feet from where they stood. Instantly
      the girl in the clearing was electrified into action. Like a tigress
      charging those who stalked her she leaped swiftly across the clearing
      toward the point from which the disturbance had come. There was an
      answering commotion in the underbrush as the girl crashed through, a
      slender knife gleaming in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge and his companions heard the sounds of a swift and short pursuit
      followed by voices, one masterful, the other frightened and whimpering;
      and a moment afterward the girl reappeared dragging a boy with her&mdash;a
      wide-eyed, terrified, country boy who begged and blubbered to no avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside the dead man the girl halted and then turned on her captive. In her
      right hand she still held the menacing blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you do there watching me for?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Tell me the truth, or
      I kill you,&rdquo; and she half raised the knife that he might profit in his
      decision by this most potent of arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy cowered. &ldquo;I didn't come fer to watch you,&rdquo; he whimpered. &ldquo;I'm
      lookin' for somebody else. I'm goin' to be a dee-tectiff, an' I'm
      shadderin' a murderer;&rdquo; and he gasped and stammered: &ldquo;But not you. I'm
      lookin' for another murderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time the watchers saw a faint smile touch the girl's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other murderer?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Who has been murdered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two an' mebby three in Oakdale last night,&rdquo; said Willie Case more glibly
      now that a chance for disseminating gossip momentarily outweighed his own
      fears. &ldquo;Reginald Paynter was murdered an' ol' man Baggs an' Abigail Prim's
      missin'. Like es not she's been murdered too, though they do say as she
      had a hand in it, bein' seen with Paynter an' The Oskaloosie Kid jest
      afore the murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the boy's tale reached the ears of the three hidden in the underbrush
      Bridge glanced quickly at his companions. He saw the boy's horror-stricken
      expression follow the announcement of the name of the murdered Paynter,
      and he saw the girl flush crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without urging, Willie Case proceeded with his story. He told of the
      coming of The Oskaloosa Kid to his father's farm that morning and of
      seeing some of the loot and hearing the confession of robbery and killing
      in Oakdale the night before. Bridge looked down at the youth beside him;
      but the other's face was averted and his eyes upon the ground. Then Willie
      told of the arrival of the great detective, of the reward that had been
      offered and of his decision to win it and become rich and famous in a
      single stroke. As he reached the end of his narrative he leaned close to
      the girl, whispering in her ear the while his furtive gaze wandered toward
      the spot where the three lay concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge shrugged his shoulders as the palpable inference of that cunning
      glance was borne in upon him. The boy's voice had risen despite his
      efforts to hold it to a low whisper for what with the excitement of the
      adventure and his terror of the girl with the knife he had little or no
      control of himself, yet it was evident that he did not realize that
      practically every word he had spoken had reached the ears of the three in
      hiding and that his final precaution as he divulged the information to the
      girl was prompted by an excess of timidity and secretiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the girl widened in surprise and fear as she learned that
      three watchers lay concealed at the verge of the clearing. She bent a
      long, searching look in the direction indicated by the boy and then turned
      her eyes quickly toward the hut as though to summon aid. At the same
      moment Bridge stepped from hiding into the clearing. His pleasant 'Good
      morning!' brought the girl around, facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you want?&rdquo; she snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you and this young man,&rdquo; said Bridge, his voice now suddenly
      stern. &ldquo;We have been watching you and followed you from the Squibbs house.
      We found the dead man there last night;&rdquo; Bridge nodded toward the quilt
      enveloped thing upon the ground; &ldquo;and we suspect that you had an
      accomplice.&rdquo; Here he frowned meaningly upon Willie Case. The youth
      trembled and stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never seen her afore,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I don' know nothin' about it. Honest
      I don't.&rdquo; But the girl did not quail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get out,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;You a bad man. Kill, steal. He know; he
      tell me. You get out or I call Beppo. He keel you. He eat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, now, my dear,&rdquo; urged Bridge, &ldquo;be calm. Let us get at the root
      of this thing. Your young friend accuses me of being a murderer, does he?
      And he tells about murders in Oakdale that I have not even heard of. It
      seems to me that he must have some guilty knowledge himself of these
      affairs. Look at him and look at me. Notice his ears, his chin, his
      forehead, or rather the places where his chin and forehead should be, and
      then look once more at me. Which of us might be a murderer and which a
      detective? I ask you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as for yourself. I find you here in the depths of the wood digging a
      lonely grave for a human corpse. I ask myself: was this man murdered? but
      I do not say that he was murdered. I wait for an explanation from you, for
      you do not look a murderer, though I cannot say as much for your desperate
      companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked straight into Bridge's eyes for a full minute before she
      replied as though endeavoring to read his inmost soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know this boy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is the truth. He was spying on
      me, and when I found him he told me that you and your companions were
      thieves and murderers and that you were hiding there watching me. You tell
      me the truth, all the truth, and I will tell you the truth. I have nothing
      to fear. If you do not tell me the truth I shall know it. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Bridge, and then turning toward the brush he called:
      &ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; and presently a boy and a girl, dishevelled and fearful,
      crawled forth into sight. Willie Case's eyes went wide as they fell upon
      the Oskaloosa Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly and simply Bridge told the girl the story of the past night, for
      he saw that by enlisting her sympathy he might find an avenue of escape
      for his companions, or at least a haven of refuge where they might hide
      until escape was possible. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; he said in conclusion, &ldquo;when the
      searchers arrived we followed the foot prints of yourself and the bear
      until we came upon you digging this grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge's companions and Willie Case looked their surprise at his mention
      of a bear; but the gypsy girl only nodded her head as she had occasionally
      during his narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;It is not easy to deceive Giova. Now I
      tell you. This here,&rdquo; she pointed toward the dead man, &ldquo;he my father. He
      bad man. Steal; kill; drink; fight; but always good to Giova. Good to no
      one else but Beppo. He afraid Beppo. Even our people drive us out he, my
      father, so bad man. We wander 'round country mak leetle money when Beppo
      dance; mak lot money when HE steal. Two days he no come home. I go las'
      night look for him. Sometimes he too drunk come home he sleep Squeebs. I
      go there. I find heem dead. He have fits, six, seven year. He die fit.
      Beppo stay guard heem. I carry heem home. Giova strong, he no very large
      man. Beppo come too. I bury heem. No one know we leeve here. Pretty soon I
      go way with Beppo. Why tell people he dead. Who care? Mak lot trouble for
      Giova whose heart already ache plenty. No one love heem, only Beppo and
      Giova. No one love Giova, only Beppo; but some day Beppo he keel Giova now
      HE is dead, for Beppo vera large, strong bear&mdash;fierce bear&mdash;ogly
      bear. Even Giova who love Beppo is afraid Beppo. Beppo devil bear! Beppo
      got evil eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bridge, &ldquo;I guess, Giova, that you and we are in the same
      boat. We haven't any of us done anything so very bad but it would be
      embarrassing to have to explain to the police what we have done,&rdquo; here he
      glanced at The Oskaloosa Kid and the girl standing beside the youth.
      &ldquo;Suppose we form a defensive alliance, eh? We'll help you and you help us.
      What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; acquiesced Giova; &ldquo;but what we do with this?&rdquo; and she jerked
      her thumb toward Willie Case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he don't behave we'll feed him to Beppo,&rdquo; suggested Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willie shook in his boots, figuratively speaking, for in reality he shook
      upon his bare feet. &ldquo;Lemme go,&rdquo; he wailed, &ldquo;an' I won't tell nobody
      nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bridge, &ldquo;you don't go until we're safely out of here. I
      wouldn't trust that vanishing chin of yours as far as I could throw Beppo
      by the tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; exclaimed The Oskaloosa Kid. &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you?&rdquo; asked Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; cried the boy excitedly. &ldquo;This boy has been offered a hundred
      dollars for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the men
      who robbed and murdered in Oakdale last night. I'll give him a hundred
      dollars if he'll go away and say nothing about us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, son,&rdquo; said Bridge, &ldquo;every time you open your mouth you put
      your foot in it. The less you advertise the fact that you have a hundred
      dollars the better off you'll be. I don't know how you come by so much
      wealth; but in view of several things which occurred last night I should
      not be crazy, were I you, to have to make a true income tax return.
      Somehow I have faith in you; but I doubt if any minion of the law would be
      similarly impressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid appeared hurt and crestfallen. Giova shot a suspicious
      glance at him. The other girl involuntarily drew away. Bridge noted the
      act and shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we mustn't judge one another
      hastily, Miss Prim, and I take it you are Miss Prim?&rdquo; The girl made a half
      gesture of denial, started to speak, hesitated and then resumed. &ldquo;I would
      rather not say who I am, please,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;let's take one another at face value for a while,
      without digging too deep into the past; and now for our plans. This wood
      will be searched; but I don't see how we are to get out of it before dark
      as the roads are doubtless pretty well patrolled, or at least every farmer
      is on the lookout for suspicious strangers. So we might as well make the
      best of it here for the rest of the day. I think we're reasonably safe for
      the time being&mdash;if we keep Willie with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willie had been an interested auditor of all that passed between his
      captors. He was obviously terrified; but his terror did not prevent him
      from absorbing all that he heard, nor from planning how he might utilize
      the information. He saw not only one reward but several and a glorious
      publicity which far transcended the most sanguine of his former dreams. He
      saw his picture not only in the Oakdale Tribune but in the newspapers of
      every city of the country. Assuming a stern and arrogant expression, or
      rather what he thought to be such, he posed, mentally, for the newspaper
      cameramen; and such is the power of association of ideas that he was
      presently strolling nonchalantly before a battery of motion picture
      machines. &ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;won't the other fellers be sore! I s'ppose
      Pinkerton'll send for me 'bout the first thing 'n' offer me twenty fi'
      dollars a week, er mebbie more 'n thet. Gol durn, ef I don't hold out fer
      thirty! Gee!&rdquo; Words, thoughts even, failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the others planned they rather neglected Willie and when they came to
      assisting Giova in lowering her father into the grave and covering him
      over with earth they quite forgot Willie entirely. It was The Oskaloosa
      Kid who first thought of him. &ldquo;Where's the boy?&rdquo; he cried suddenly. The
      others looked quickly about the clearing, but no Willie was to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge shook his head ruefully. &ldquo;We'll have to get out of this in a hurry
      now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That little defective will have the whole neighborhood on
      us in an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what can we do?&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;They mustn't find us! I should
      rather die than be found here with&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped abruptly, flushed
      scarlet as the other three looked at her in silence, and then: &ldquo;I am
      sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn't know what I was saying. I am so frightened.
      You have all been good to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what we do.&rdquo; It was Giova speaking in the masterful voice of
      one who has perfect confidence in his own powers. &ldquo;I know fine way out.
      This wood circle back south through swamp mile, mile an' a half. The road
      past Squeebs an' Case's go right through it. I know path there I fin'
      myself. We on'y have to cross road, that only danger. Then we reach leetle
      stream south of woods, stream wind down through Payson. We all go Gypsies.
      I got lot clothing in house. We all go Gypsies, an' when we reach Payson
      we no try hide&mdash;jus' come out on street with Beppo. Mak' Beppo dance.
      No one think we try hide. Then come night we go 'way. Find more wood an'
      leetle lake other side Payson. I know place. We hide there long time. No
      one ever fin' us there. We tell two, three, four people in Payson we go
      Oakdale. They look Oakdale for us if they wan' fin' us. They no think look
      where we go. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can't go to Payson,&rdquo; exclaimed the other girl. &ldquo;Someone would be
      sure to recognize me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come in house with me,&rdquo; Giova assured her, &ldquo;I feex you so your own
      mother no know you. You mens come too. I geeve you what to wear like Gypsy
      mens. We got lots things. My father, him he steal many things from our
      people after they drive us out. He go back by nights an' steal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three followed her toward the little hovel since there seemed no
      better plan than that which she had offered. Giova and the other girl were
      in the lead, followed by Bridge and the boy. The latter turned to the man
      and placed a hand upon his arm. &ldquo;Why don't you leave us,&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You
      have done nothing. No one is looking for you. Why don't you go your way
      and save yourself from suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; the youth went on, &ldquo;that you are doing it for me; but why I
      can't guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I am,&rdquo; Bridge half acknowledged. &ldquo;You're a good little kid, but you
      need someone to look after you. It would be easier though if you'd tell me
      the truth about yourself, which you certainly haven't up to now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't ask me,&rdquo; begged the boy. &ldquo;I can't; honestly I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it as bad as that?&rdquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's worse,&rdquo; cried The Oskaloosa Kid. &ldquo;It's a thousand times worse.
      Don't make me tell you, for if I do tell I shall have to leave you, and&mdash;and,
      oh, Bridge, I don't want to leave you&mdash;ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the door of the cabin now and were looking in past the
      girl who had halted there as Giova entered. Before them was a small room
      in which a large, vicious looking brown bear was chained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold our ghost of last night!&rdquo; exclaimed Bridge. &ldquo;By George! though,
      I'd as soon have hunted a real ghost in the dark as to have run into this
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know last night that it was a bear?&rdquo; asked the Kid. &ldquo;You told
      Giova that you followed the footprints of herself and her bear; but you
      had not said anything about a bear to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had an idea last night,&rdquo; explained Bridge, &ldquo;that the sounds were
      produced by some animal dragging a chain; but I couldn't prove it and so I
      said nothing, and then this morning while we were following the trail I
      made up my mind that it was a bear. There were two facts which argued that
      such was the case. The first is that I don't believe in ghosts and that
      even if I did I would not expect a ghost to leave footprints in the mud,
      and the other is that I knew that the footprints of a bear are strangely
      similar to those of the naked feet of man. Then when I saw the Gypsy girl
      I was sure that what we had heard last night was nothing more nor less
      than a trained bear. The dress and appearance of the dead man lent
      themselves to a furtherance of my belief and the wisp of brown hair
      clutched in his fingers added still further proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within the room the bear was now straining at his collar and growling
      ferociously at the strangers. Giova crossed the room, scolding him and at
      the same time attempting to assure him that the newcomers were friends;
      but the wicked expression upon the beast's face gave no indication that he
      would ever accept them as aught but enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a breathless Willie who broke into his mother's kitchen wide eyed
      and gasping from the effects of excitement and a long, hard run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fer lan' sakes!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Case. &ldquo;Whatever in the world ails you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got 'em; I got 'em!&rdquo; cried Willie, dashing for the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fer lan' sakes! I should think you did hev 'em,&rdquo; retorted his mother as
      she trailed after him in the direction of the front hall. &ldquo;'N' whatever
      you got, you got 'em bad. Now you stop right where you air 'n' tell me
      whatever you got. 'Taint likely it's measles, fer you've hed them three
      times, 'n' whoopin' cough ain't 'them,' it's 'it,' 'n'&mdash;.&rdquo; Mrs. Case
      paused and gasped&mdash;horrified. &ldquo;Fer lan' sakes, Willie Case, you come
      right out o' this house this minute ef you got anything in your head.&rdquo; She
      made a grab for Willie's arm; but the boy dodged and reached the
      telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I ain't got nothin' in my head,&rdquo; nor did either sense
      the unconscious humor of the statement. &ldquo;What I got is a gang o' thieves
      an' murderers, an' I'm callin' up thet big city deetectiff to come arter
      'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Case sank into a chair, prostrated by the weight of her emotions,
      while Willie took down the receiver after ringing the bell to attract
      central. Finally he obtained his connection, which was with Jonas Prim's
      bank where detective Burton was making his headquarters. Here he learned
      that Burton had not returned; but finally gave his message reluctantly to
      Jonas Prim after exacting a promise from that gentleman that he would be
      personally responsible for the payment of the reward. What Willie Case
      told Jonas Prim had the latter in a machine, with half a dozen deputy
      sheriffs and speeding southward from Oakdale inside of ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short distance out from town they met detective Burton with his two
      prisoners. After a hurried consultation Dopey Charlie and The General were
      unloaded and started on the remainder of their journey afoot under guard
      of two of the deputies, while Burton's companions turned and followed the
      other car, Burton taking a seat beside Prim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that he could take us right to where Abigail is,&rdquo; Mr. Prim was
      explaining to Burton, &ldquo;and that this Oskaloosa Kid is with her, and
      another man and a foreign looking girl. He told a wild story about seeing
      them burying a dead man in the woods back of Squibbs' place. I don't know
      how much to believe, or whether to believe any of it; but we can't afford
      not to run down every clew. I can't believe that my daughter is wilfully
      consorting with such men. She always has been full of life and spirit; but
      she's got a clean mind, and her little escapades have always been entirely
      harmless&mdash;at worst some sort of boyish prank. I simply won't believe
      it until I see it with my own eyes. If she's with them she's being held by
      force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burton made no reply. He was not a man to jump to conclusions. His success
      was largely due to the fact that he assumed nothing; but merely ran down
      each clew quickly yet painstakingly until he had a foundation of fact upon
      which to operate. His theory was that the simplest way is always the best
      way and so he never befogged the main issue with any elaborate system of
      deductive reasoning based on guesswork. Burton never guessed. He assumed
      that it was his business to KNOW, nor was he on any case long before he
      did know. He was employed now to find Abigail Prim. Each of the several
      crimes committed the previous night might or might not prove a clew to her
      whereabouts; but each must be run down in the process of elimination
      before Burton could feel safe in abandoning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already he had solved one of them to his satisfaction; and Dopey Charlie
      and The General were, all unknown to themselves, on the way to the gallows
      for the murder of Old John Baggs. When Burton had found them simulating
      sleep behind the bushes beside the road his observant eyes had noticed
      something that resembled a hurried cache. The excuse of a lost note book
      had taken him back to investigate and to find the loot of the Baggs's
      crime wrapped in a bloody rag and hastily buried in a shallow hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Burton and Jonas Prim arrived at the Case farm they were met by a new
      Willie. A puffed and important young man swaggered before them as he
      retold his tale and led them through the woods toward the spot where they
      were to bag their prey. The last hundred yards was made on hands and
      knees; but when the party arrived at the clearing there was no one in
      sight, only the hovel stood mute and hollow-eyed before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be inside,&rdquo; whispered Willie to the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burton passed a whispered word to his followers. Stealthily they crept
      through the underbrush until the cabin was surrounded; then, at a signal
      from their leader they rose and advanced upon the structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      No evidence of life indicated their presence had been noted, and Burton
      came to the very door of the cabin unchallenged. The others saw him pause
      an instant upon the threshold and then pass in. They closed behind him.
      Three minutes later he emerged, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one here,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willie Case was crestfallen. &ldquo;But they must be,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;They must
      be. I saw 'em here just a leetle while back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burton turned and eyed the boy sternly. Willie quailed. &ldquo;I seen 'em,&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;Hones' I seen 'em. They was here just a few minutes ago. Here's
      where they burrit the dead man,&rdquo; and he pointed to the little mound of
      earth near the center of the clearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see,&rdquo; commented Burton, tersely, and he sent two of his men back to
      the Case farm for spades. When they returned a few minutes' labor revealed
      that so much of Willie's story was true, for a quilt wrapped corpse was
      presently unearthed and lying upon the ground beside its violated grave.
      Willie's stock rose once more to par.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an improvised litter they carried the dead man back to Case's farm
      where they left him after notifying the coroner by telephone. Half of
      Burton's men were sent to the north side of the woods and half to the road
      upon the south of the Squibbs' farm. There they separated and formed a
      thin line of outposts about the entire area north of the road. If the
      quarry was within it could not escape without being seen. In the mean time
      Burton telephoned to Oakdale for reinforcements, as it would require fifty
      men at least to properly beat the tangled underbrush of the wood.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In a clump of willows beside the little stream which winds through the
      town of Payson a party of four halted on the outskirts of the town. There
      were two men, two young women and a huge brown bear. The men and women
      were, obviously, Gypsies. Their clothing, their head-dress, their barbaric
      ornamentation proclaimed the fact to whoever might pass; but no one
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Bridge, &ldquo;that we will just stay where we are until after
      dark. We haven't passed or seen a human being since we left the cabin. No
      one can know that we are here and if we stay here until late to-night we
      should be able to pass around Payson unseen and reach the wood to the
      south of town. If we do meet anyone to-night we'll stop them and inquire
      the way to Oakdale&mdash;that'll throw them off the track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The others acquiesced in his suggestion; but there were queries about food
      to be answered. It seemed that all were hungry and that the bear was
      ravenous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he eat?&rdquo; Bridge asked of Giova.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mos' anything,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;He like garbage fine. Often I take him
      into towns late, ver' late at night an' he eat swill. I do that to-night.
      Beppo, he got to be fed or he eat Giova. I go feed Beppo, you go get food
      for us; then we all meet at edge of wood just other side town near old
      mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the remainder of the afternoon and well after dark the party
      remained hidden in the willows. Then Giova started out with Beppo in
      search of garbage cans, Bridge bent his steps toward a small store upon
      the outskirts of town where food could be purchased, The Oskaloosa Kid
      having donated a ten dollar bill for the stocking of the commissariat, and
      the youth and the girl made their way around the south end of the town
      toward the meeting place beside the old mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Bridge moved through the quiet road at the outskirts of the little town
      he let his mind revert to the events of the past twenty four hours and as
      he pondered each happening since he met the youth in the dark of the storm
      the preceding night he asked himself why he had cast his lot with these
      strangers. In his years of vagabondage Bridge had never crossed that
      invisible line which separates honest men from thieves and murderers and
      which, once crossed, may never be recrossed. Chance and necessity had
      thrown him often among such men and women; but never had he been of them.
      The police of more than one city knew Bridge&mdash;they knew him, though,
      as a character and not as a criminal. A dozen times he had been arraigned
      upon suspicion; but as many times had he been released with a clean bill
      of morals until of late Bridge had become almost immune from arrest. The
      police who knew him knew that he was straight and they knew, too, that he
      would give no information against another man. For this they admired him
      as did the majority of the criminals with whom he had come in contact
      during his rovings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present crisis, however, appeared most unpromising to Bridge. Grave
      crimes had been committed in Oakdale, and here was Bridge conniving in the
      escape of at least two people who might readily be under police suspicion.
      It was difficult for the man to bring himself to believe that either the
      youth or the girl was in any way actually responsible for either of the
      murders; yet it appeared that the latter had been present when a murder
      was committed and now by attempting to elude the police had become an
      accessory after the fact, since she possessed knowledge of the identity of
      the actual murderer; while the boy, by his own admission, had committed a
      burglary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge shook his head wearily. Was he not himself an accessory after the
      fact in the matter of two crimes at least? These new friends, it seemed,
      were about to topple him into the abyss which he had studiously avoided
      for so long a time. But why should he permit it? What were they to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      A freight train was puffing into the siding at the Payson station. Bridge
      could hear the complaining brakes a mile away. It would be easy to leave
      the town and his dangerous companions far behind him; but even as the
      thought forced its way into his mind another obtruded itself to shoulder
      aside the first. It was recollection of the boy's words: &ldquo;Oh, Bridge, I
      don't want to leave you&mdash;ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't do it,&rdquo; mused Bridge. &ldquo;I don't know just why; but I couldn't.
      That kid has certainly got me. The first thing someone knows I'll be
      starting a foundlings' home. There is no question but that I am the soft
      mark, and I wonder why it is&mdash;why a kid I never saw before last night
      has a strangle hold on my heart that I can't shake loose&mdash;and don't
      want to. Now if it was a girl I could understand it.&rdquo; Bridge stopped
      suddenly in the middle of the road. From his attitude he might have been
      startled either by a surprising noise or by a surprising thought. For a
      minute he stood motionless; then he shook his head again and proceeded
      along his way toward the little store; evidently if he had heard anything
      he was assured that it constituted no menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the store to make his purchases a foxeyed man saw him and
      stepped quickly behind the huge stove which had not as yet been taken down
      for the summer. Bridge made his purchases, the volume of which required a
      large gunny-sack for transportation, and while he was thus occupied the
      fox-eyed man clung to his coign of vantage, himself unnoticed by the
      purchaser. When Bridge departed the other followed him, keeping in the
      shadow of the trees which bordered the street. Around the edge of town and
      down a road which led southward the two went until Bridge passed through a
      broken fence and halted beside an abandoned mill. The watcher saw his
      quarry set down his burden, seat himself beside it and proceed to roll a
      cigaret; then he faded away in the darkness and Bridge was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five or ten minutes later two slender figures appeared dimly out of the
      north. They approached timidly, stopping often and looking first this way
      and then that and always listening. When they arrived opposite the mill
      Bridge saw them and gave a low whistle. Immediately the two passed through
      the fence and approached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; exclaimed one. &ldquo;I thought we never would get here; but we didn't see
      a soul on the road. Where is Giova?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn't come yet,&rdquo; replied Bridge, &ldquo;and she may not. I don't see how a
      girl can browse around a town like this with a big bear at night and not
      be seen, and if she is seen she'll be followed&mdash;it would be too much
      of a treat for the rubes ever to be passed up&mdash;and if she's followed
      she won't come here. At least I hope she won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; exclaimed The Oskaloosa Kid. Each stood in silence,
      listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl shuddered. &ldquo;Even now that I know what it is it makes me creep,&rdquo;
       she whispered, as the faint clanking of a distant chain came to their
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to be used to it by this time, Miss Prim,&rdquo; said Bridge. &ldquo;We
      heard it all last night and a good part of to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl made no comment upon the use of the name which he had applied to
      her, and in the darkness he could not see her features, nor did he see the
      odd expression upon the boy's face as he heard the name addressed to her.
      Was he thinking of the nocturnal raid he so recently had made upon the
      boudoir of Miss Abigail Prim? Was he pondering the fact that his pockets
      bulged to the stolen belongings of that young lady? But whatever was
      passing in his mind he permitted none of it to pass his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the three stood waiting in silence Giova came presently among them, the
      beast Beppo lumbering awkwardly at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he find anything to eat?&rdquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; exclaimed Giova. &ldquo;He fill up now. That mak him better nature.
      Beppo not so ugly now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glad of that,&rdquo; said Bridge. &ldquo;I haven't been looking forward
      much to his company through the woods to-night&mdash;especially while he
      was hungry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giova laughed a low, musical little laugh. &ldquo;I don' think he no hurt you
      anyway,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now he know you my frien'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are quite correct in your surmise,&rdquo; replied Bridge. &ldquo;But even
      so I'm not taking any chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Willie Case had been taken to Payson to testify before the coroner's jury
      investigating the death of Giova's father, and with the dollar which The
      Oskaloosa Kid had given him in the morning burning in his pocket had
      proceeded to indulge in an orgy of dissipation the moment that he had been
      freed from the inquest. Ice cream, red pop, peanuts, candy, and soda water
      may have diminished his appetite but not his pride and self-satisfaction
      as he sat alone and by night for the first time in a public eating place.
      Willie was now a man of the world, a bon vivant, as he ordered ham and
      eggs from the pretty waitress of The Elite Restaurant on Broadway; but at
      heart he was not happy for never before had he realized what a great
      proportion of his anatomy was made up of hands and feet. As he glanced
      fearfully at the former, silhouetted against the white of the table cloth,
      he flushed scarlet, assured as he was that the waitress who had just
      turned away toward the kitchen with his order was convulsed with laughter
      and that every other eye in the establishment was glued upon him. To
      assume an air of nonchalance and thereby impress and disarm his critics
      Willie reached for a toothpick in the little glass holder near the center
      of the table and upset the sugar bowl. Immediately Willie snatched back
      the offending hand and glared ferociously at the ceiling. He could feel
      the roots of his hair being consumed in the heat of his skin. A quick side
      glance that required all his will power to consummate showed him that no
      one appeared to have noticed his faux pas and Willie was again slowly
      returning to normal when the proprietor of the restaurant came up from
      behind and asked him to remove his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had Willie Case spent so frightful a half hour as that within the
      brilliant interior of The Elite Restaurant. Twenty-three minutes of this
      eternity was consumed in waiting for his order to be served and seven
      minutes in disposing of the meal and paying his check. Willie's method of
      eating was in itself a sermon on efficiency&mdash;there was no lost motion&mdash;no
      waste of time. He placed his mouth within two inches of his plate after
      cutting his ham and eggs into pieces of a size that would permit each
      mouthful to enter without wedging; then he mixed his mashed potatoes in
      with the result and working his knife and fork alternately with
      bewildering rapidity shot a continuous stream of food into his gaping maw.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the meat and potatoes there was one vegetable in a
      side-dish and as dessert four prunes. The meat course gone Willie placed
      the vegetable dish on the empty plate, seized a spoon in lieu of knife and
      fork and&mdash;presto! the side-dish was empty. Whereupon the prune dish
      was set in the empty side-dish&mdash;four deft motions and there were no
      prunes&mdash;in the dish. The entire feat had been accomplished in 6:34
      1/2, setting a new world's record for red-headed farmer boys with one
      splay foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the remaining twenty five and one half seconds Willie walked what
      seemed to him a mile from his seat to the cashier's desk and at the last
      instant bumped into a waitress with a trayful of dishes. Clutched tightly
      in Willie's hand was thirty five cents and his check with a like amount
      written upon it. Amid the crash of crockery which followed the collision
      Willie slammed check and money upon the cashier's desk and fled. Nor did
      he pause until in the reassuring seclusion of a dark side street. There
      Willie sank upon the curb alternately cold with fear and hot with shame,
      weak and panting, and into his heart entered the iron of class hatred,
      searing it to the core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for youth it recuperates rapidly from mortal blows, and so it
      was that another half hour found Willie wandering up and down Broadway but
      at the far end of the street from The Elite Restaurant. A motion picture
      theater arrested his attention; and presently, parting with one of his two
      remaining dimes, he entered. The feature of the bill was a detective
      melodrama. Nothing in the world could have better suited Willie's psychic
      needs. It recalled his earlier feats of the day, in which he took
      pardonable pride, and raised him once again to a self-confidence he had
      not felt since he entered the ever to be hated Elite Restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The show over Willie set forth afoot for home. A long walk lay ahead of
      him. This in itself was bad enough; but what lay at the end of the long
      walk was infinitely worse, as Willie's father had warned him to return
      immediately after the inquest, in time for milking, preferably. Before he
      had gone two blocks from the theater Willie had concocted at least three
      tales to account for his tardiness, either one of which would have done
      credit to the imaginative powers of a Rider Haggard or a Jules Verne; but
      at the end of the third block he caught a glimpse of something which drove
      all thoughts of home from his mind and came but barely short of driving
      his mind out too. He was approaching the entrance to an alley. Old trees
      grew in the parkway at his side. At the street corner a half block away a
      high flung arc swung gently from its supporting cables, casting a fair
      light upon the alley's mouth, and just emerging from behind the nearer
      fence Willie Case saw the huge bulk of a bear. Terrified, Willie jumped
      behind a tree; and then, fearful lest the animal might have caught sight
      or scent of him he poked his head cautiously around the side of the bole
      just in time to see the figure of a girl come out of the alley behind the
      bear. Willie recognized her at the first glance&mdash;she was the very
      girl he had seen burying the dead man in the Squibbs woods. Instantly
      Willie Case was transformed again into the shrewd and death defying
      sleuth. At a safe distance he followed the girl and the bear through one
      alley after another until they came out upon the road which leads south
      from Payson. He was across the road when she joined Bridge and his
      companions. When they turned toward the old mill he followed them,
      listening close to the rotting clapboards for any chance remark which
      might indicate their future plans. He heard them debating the wisdom of
      remaining where they were for the night or moving on to another location
      which they had evidently decided upon but no clew to which they dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The objection to remaining here,&rdquo; said Bridge, &ldquo;is that we can't make a
      fire to cook by&mdash;it would be too plainly visible from the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can no fin' road by dark,&rdquo; explained Giova. &ldquo;It bad road by day,
      ver' much worse by night. Beppo no come 'cross swamp by night. No, we got
      stay here til morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Bridge, &ldquo;we can eat some of this canned stuff and
      have our ham and coffee after we reach camp tomorrow morning, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that we've gotten through Payson safely,&rdquo; suggested The Oskaloosa
      Kid, &ldquo;let's change back into our own clothes. This disguise makes me feel
      too conspicuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willie Case had heard enough. His quarry would remain where it was over
      night, and a moment later Willie was racing toward Payson and a telephone
      as fast as his legs would carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an old brick structure a hundred yards below the mill where the
      lighting machinery of Payson had been installed before the days of the
      great central power plant a hundred miles away four men were smoking as
      they lay stretched upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I seen him,&rdquo; asserted one of the party. &ldquo;I follered this
      Bridge guy from town to the mill. He was got up like a Gyp; but I knew him
      all right, all right. This scenery of his made me tink there was something
      phoney doin', or I wouldn't have trailed him, an' its a good ting I done
      it, fer he hadn't ben there five minutes before along comes The Kid an' a
      skirt and pretty soon a nudder chicken wid a calf on a string, er mebbie
      it was a sheep&mdash;it was pretty husky lookin' fer a sheep though. An' I
      sticks aroun' a minute until I hears this here Bridge guy call the first
      skirt 'Miss Prim.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased speaking to note the effect of his words on his hearers. They
      were electrical. The Sky Pilot sat up straight and slapped his thigh. Soup
      Face opened his mouth, letting his pipe fall out into his lap, setting
      fire to his ragged trousers. Dirty Eddie voiced a characteristic
      obscenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you sees,&rdquo; went on Columbus Blackie, &ldquo;we got a chanct to get both the
      dame and The Kid. Two of us can take her to Oakdale an' claim the reward
      her old man's offerin' an' de odder two can frisk de Kid, an'&mdash;an'&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' wot?&rdquo; queried The Sky Pilot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dere's de swamp handy,&rdquo; suggested Soup Face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was tinkin' of de swamp,&rdquo; said Columbus Blackie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eddie and I will return Miss Prim to her bereaved parents,&rdquo; interrupted
      The Sky Pilot. &ldquo;You, Blackie, and Soup Face can arrange matters with The
      Oskaloosa Kid. I don't care for details. We will all meet in Toledo as
      soon as possible and split the swag. We ought to make a cleaning on this
      job, boes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spit a mout'ful then,&rdquo; said Columbus Blackie.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell to discussing way and means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd better wait until they're asleep,&rdquo; counseled The Sky Pilot. &ldquo;Two of
      us can tackle this Bridge and hand him the k.o. quick. Eddie and Soup Face
      had better attend to that. Blackie can nab The Kid an' I'll annex Miss
      Abigail Prim. The lady with the calf we don't want. We'll tell her we're
      officers of the law an' that she'd better duck with her live stock an'
      keep her trap shut if she don't want to get mixed up with a murder trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Detective Burton was at the county jail in Oakdale administering the third
      degree to Dopey Charlie and The General when there came a long distance
      telephone call for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said the voice at the other end of the line; &ldquo;I'm Willie Case,
      an' I've found Miss Abigail Prim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again?&rdquo; queried Burton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; asserted Willie. &ldquo;I know where she's goin' to be all night. I
      heard 'em say so. The Oskaloosie Kid's with her an' annuder guy an' the
      girl I seen with the dead man in Squibbs' woods an' they got a BEAR!&rdquo; It
      was almost a shriek. &ldquo;You'd better come right away an' bring Mr. Prim.
      I'll meet you on the ol' Toledo road right south of Payson, an' say, do I
      get the whole reward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get whatever's coming to you, son,&rdquo; replied Burton. &ldquo;You say there
      are two men and two women&mdash;are you sure that is all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the bear,&rdquo; corrected Willie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, keep quiet and wait for me,&rdquo; cautioned Burton. &ldquo;You'll know me
      by the spot light on my car&mdash;I'll have it pointed straight up into
      the air. When you see it coming get into the middle of the road and wave
      your hands to stop us. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Willie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don't talk to anyone,&rdquo; Burton again cautioned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Burton left Oakdale with his two lieutenants and a
      couple of the local policemen, the car turning south toward Payson and
      moving at ever accelerating speed as it left the town streets behind it
      and swung smoothly onto the country road.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It was after midnight when four men cautiously approached the old mill.
      There was no light nor any sign of life within as they crept silently
      through the doorless doorway. Columbus Blackie was in the lead. He flashed
      a quick light around the interior revealing four forms stretched upon the
      floor, deep in slumber. Into the blacker shadows of the far end of the
      room the man failed to shine his light for the first flash had shown him
      those whom he sought. Picking out their quarry the intruders made a sudden
      rush upon the sleepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge awoke to find two men attempting to rain murderous blows upon his
      head. Wiry, strong and full of the vigor of a clean life, he pitted
      against their greater numbers and cowardly attack a defense which was
      infinitely more strenuous than they had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Columbus Blackie leaped for The Oskaloosa Kid, while The Sky Pilot seized
      upon Abigail Prim. No one paid any attention to Giova, nor, with the noise
      and confusion, did the intruders note the sudden clanking of a chain from
      out the black depths of the room's further end, or the splintering of a
      half decayed studding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soup Face entangling himself about Bridge's legs succeeded in throwing the
      latter to the floor while Dirty Eddie kicked viciously at the prostrate
      man's head. The Sky Pilot seized Abigail Prim about the waist and dragged
      her toward the doorway and though the girl fought valiantly to free
      herself her lesser muscles were unable to cope successfully with those of
      the man. Columbus Blackie found his hands full with The Oskaloosa Kid.
      Again and again the youth struck him in the face; but the man persisted,
      beating down the slim hands and striking viciously at body and head until,
      at last, the boy, half stunned though still struggling, was dragged from
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously a series of frightful growls reverberated through the
      deserted mill. A huge body catapulted into the midst of the fighters.
      Abigail Prim screamed. &ldquo;The bear!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The bear is loose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dirty Eddie was the first to feel the weight of Beppo's wrath. His foot
      drawn back to implant a vicious kick in Bridge's face he paused at the
      girl's scream and at the same moment a huge thing reared up before him.
      Just for an instant he sensed the terrifying presence of some frightful
      creature, caught the reflected gleam of two savage eyes and felt the hot
      breath from distended jaws upon his cheek, then Beppo swung a single
      terrific blow which caught the man upon the side of the head to spin him
      across the floor and drop him in a crumpled heap against the wall, with a
      fractured skull. Dirty Eddie was out. Soup Face, giving voice to a scream
      more bestial than human, rose to his feet and fled in the opposite
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beppo paused and looked about. He discovered Bridge lying upon the floor
      and sniffed at him. The man lay perfectly quiet. He had heard that often
      times a bear will not molest a creature which it thinks dead. Be that as
      it may Beppo chanced at that moment to glance toward the doorway. There,
      silhouetted against the lesser darkness without, he saw the figures of
      Columbus Blackie and The Oskaloosa Kid and with a growl he charged them.
      The two were but a few paces outside the doorway when the full weight of
      the great bear struck Columbus Blackie between the shoulders. Down went
      the man and as he fell he released his hold upon the youth who immediately
      turned and ran for the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The momentum of the bear carried him past the body of his intended victim
      who, frightened but uninjured, scrambled to his feet and dashed toward the
      rear of the mill in the direction of the woods and distant swamp. Beppo,
      recovering from his charge, wheeled in time to catch a glimpse of his
      quarry after whom he made with all the awkwardness that was his birthright
      and with the speed of a race horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Columbus Blackie, casting a terrified glance rearward, saw his Nemesis
      flashing toward him, and dodged around a large tree. Again Beppo shot past
      the man while the latter, now shrieking for help, raced madly in a new
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge had arisen and come out of the mill. He called aloud for The
      Oskaloosa Kid. Giova answered him from a small tree. &ldquo;Climb!&rdquo; she cried.
      &ldquo;Climb a tree! Ever'one climb a small tree. Beppo he go mad. He keel
      ever'one. Run! Climb! He keel me. Beppo he got evil-eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Along the road from the north came a large touring car, swinging from side
      to side in its speed. Its brilliant headlights illuminated the road far
      ahead. They picked out The Sky Pilot and Abigail Prim, they found The
      Oskaloosa Kid climbing a barbed wire fence and then with complaining
      brakes the car came to a sudden stop. Six men leaped from the machine and
      rounded up the three they had seen. Another came running toward them. It
      was Soup Face, so thoroughly terrified that he would gladly have embraced
      a policeman in uniform, could the latter have offered him protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy accompanied the newcomers. &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; he screamed, pointing at
      The Oskaloosa Kid. &ldquo;There he is! And you've got Miss Prim, too, and when
      do I get the reward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; said one of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch this bunch,&rdquo; said Burton to one of his lieutenants, &ldquo;while we go
      after the rest of them. There are some over by the mill. I can hear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the woods came a fear-filled scream mingled with the savage growls of
      a beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the bear,&rdquo; shrilled Willie Case, and ran toward the automobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge ran forward to meet Burton. &ldquo;Get that girl and the kid into your
      machine and beat it!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There's a bear loose here, a regular
      devil of a bear. You can't do a thing unless you have rifles. Have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's one of the gang,&rdquo; yelled Willie Case from the fancied security of
      the tonneau. &ldquo;Seize him!&rdquo; He wanted to add: &ldquo;My men&rdquo;; but somehow his
      nerve failed him at the last moment; however he had the satisfaction of
      thinking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge was placed in the car with Abigail Prim, The Oskaloosa Kid, Soup
      Face and The Sky Pilot. Burton sent the driver back to assist in guarding
      them; then he with the remaining three, two of whom were armed with
      rifles, advanced toward the mill. Beyond it they heard the growling of the
      bear at a little distance in the wood; but the man no longer made any
      outcry. From a tree Giova warned them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down!&rdquo; commanded Burton, and sent her back to the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver turned his spot light upon the wood beyond the mill and
      presently there came slowly forward into its rays the lumbering bulk of a
      large bear. The light bewildered him and he paused, growling. His left
      shoulder was partially exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aim for his chest, on the left side,&rdquo; whispered Burton. The two men
      raised their rifles. There were two reports in close succession. Beppo
      fell forward without a sound and then rolled over on his side. Giova
      covered her face with her hands and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ver' bad, ugly bear,&rdquo; she said brokenly; &ldquo;but he all I have to love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge extended a hand and patted her bowed head. In the eyes of The
      Oskaloosa Kid there glistened something perilously similar to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the woods back of the mill Burton and his men found the mangled remains
      of Columbus Blackie, and when they searched the interior of the structure
      they brought forth the unconscious Dirty Eddie. As the car already was
      taxed to the limit of its carrying capacity Burton left two of his men to
      march The Kid and Bridge to the Payson jail, taking the others with him to
      Oakdale. He was also partially influenced in this decision by the fear
      that mob violence would be done the principals by Oakdale's outraged
      citizens. At Payson he stopped long enough at the town jail to arrange for
      the reception of the two prisoners, to notify the coroner of the death of
      Columbus Blackie and the whereabouts of his body and to place Dirty Eddie
      in the hospital. He then telephoned Jonas Prim that his daughter was safe
      and would be returned to him in less than an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Bridge and The Oskaloosa Kid reached Payson the town was in an
      uproar. A threatening crowd met them a block from the jail; but Burton's
      men were armed with rifles which they succeeded in convincing the mob they
      would use if their prisoners were molested. The telephone, however, had
      carried the word to Oakdale; so that before Burton arrived there a dozen
      automobile loads of indignant citizens were racing south toward Payson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge and The Oskaloosa Kid were hustled into the single cell of the
      Payson jail. A bench ran along two sides of the room. A single barred
      window let out upon the yard behind the structure. The floor was littered
      with papers, and a single electric light bulb relieved the gloom of the
      unsavory place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid sank, trembling, upon one of the hard benches. Bridge
      rolled a cigaret. At his feet lay a copy of that day's Oakdale Tribune. A
      face looked up from the printed page into his eyes. He stooped and took up
      the paper. The entire front page was devoted to the various crimes which
      had turned peaceful Oakdale inside out in the past twenty four hours.
      There were reproductions of photographs of John Baggs, Reginald Paynter,
      Abigail Prim, Jonas Prim, and his wife, with a large cut of the Prim
      mansion, a star marking the boudoir of the missing daughter of the house.
      As Bridge examined the various pictures an odd expression entered his eyes&mdash;it
      was a mixture of puzzlement, incredulity, and relief. Tossing the paper
      aside he turned toward The Oskaloosa Kid. They could hear the sullen
      murmur of the crowd in front of the jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they get any booze,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they'll take us out of here and string
      us up. If you've got anything to say that would tend to convince them that
      you did not kill Paynter I advise you to call the guard and tell the
      truth, for if the mob gets us they might hang us first and listen
      afterward&mdash;a mob is not a nice thing. Beppo was an angel of mercy by
      comparison with one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you convince them that you had no part in any of these crimes?&rdquo;
       asked the boy. &ldquo;I know that you didn't; but could you prove it to a mob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bridge. &ldquo;A mob is not open to reason. If they get us I shall
      hang, unless someone happens to think of the stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell the truth?&rdquo; asked the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go with you,&rdquo; replied the boy, &ldquo;and take whatever you get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth flushed; but did not reply, for there came from without a sudden
      augmentation of the murmurings of the mob. Automobile horns screamed out
      upon the night. The two heard the chugging of motors, the sound of brakes
      and the greetings of new arrivals. The reinforcements had arrived from
      Oakdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      A guard came to the grating of the cell door. &ldquo;The bunch from Oakdale has
      come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I was you I'd say my prayers. Old man Baggs is dead.
      No one never had no use for him while he was alive, but the whole county's
      het up now over his death. They're bound to get you, an' while I didn't
      count 'em all I seen about a score o' ropes. They mean business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge turned toward the boy. &ldquo;Tell the truth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell this man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth shook his head. &ldquo;I have killed no one,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That is the
      truth. Neither have you; but if they are going to murder you they can
      murder me too, for you stuck to me when you didn't have to; and I am going
      to stick to you, and there is some excuse for me because I have a reason&mdash;the
      best reason in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Oskaloosa Kid shook his head, and once more he flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the guard, with a shrug of his shoulders, &ldquo;it's up to you
      guys. If you want to hang, why hang and be damned. We'll do the best we
      can 'cause it's our duty to protect you; but I guess at that hangin's too
      good fer you, an' we ain't a-goin' to get shot keepin' you from gettin'
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uproar in front of the jail had risen in volume until it was difficult
      for those within to make themselves heard without shouting. The Kid sat
      upon his bench and buried his face in his hands. Bridge rolled another
      smoke. The sound of a shot came from the front room of the jail,
      immediately followed by a roar of rage from the mob and a deafening
      hammering upon the jail door. A moment later this turned to the heavy
      booming of a battering ram and the splintering of wood. The frail
      structure quivered beneath the onslaught.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoners could hear the voices of the guards and the jailer raised in
      an attempt to reason with the unreasoning mob, and then came a final crash
      and the stamping of many feet upon the floor of the outer room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burton's car drew up before the doorway of the Prim home in Oakdale. The
      great detective alighted and handed down the missing Abigail. Then he
      directed that the other prisoners be taken to the county jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas Prim and his wife awaited Abigail's return in the spacious living
      room at the left of the reception hall. The banker was nervous. He paced
      to and fro the length of the room. Mrs. Prim fanned herself vigorously
      although the heat was far from excessive. They heard the motor draw up in
      front of the house; but they did not venture into the reception hall or
      out upon the porch, though for different reasons. Mrs. Prim because it
      would not have been PROPER; Jonas because he could not trust himself to
      meet his daughter, whom he had thought lost, in the presence of a possible
      crowd which might have accompanied her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard the closing of an automobile door and the sound of foot steps
      coming up the concrete walk. The Prim butler was already waiting at the
      doorway with the doors swung wide to receive the prodigal daughter of the
      house of Prim. A slender figure with bowed head ascended the steps, guided
      and assisted by the detective. She did not look up at the expectant butler
      waiting for the greeting he was sure Abigail would have for him; but
      passed on into the reception hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father and Mrs. Prim are in the living room,&rdquo; announced the butler,
      stepping forward to draw aside the heavy hangings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, followed by Burton, entered the brightly lighted room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad, Mr. Prim,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;to be able to return Miss
      Prim to you so quickly and unharmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked up into the face of Jonas Prim. The man voiced an
      exclamation of surprise and annoyance. Mrs. Prim gasped and sank upon a
      sofa. The girl stood motionless, her eyes once again bent upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; asked Burton. &ldquo;What's wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is wrong, Mr. Burton,&rdquo; Jonas Prim's voice was crisp and cold.
      &ldquo;This is not my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burton looked his surprise and discomfiture. He turned upon the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;&rdquo; he started; but she interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to ask what I mean by posing as Miss Prim,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      have never said that I was Miss Prim. You took the word of an ignorant
      little farmer's boy and I did not deny it when I found that you intended
      bringing me to Mr. Prim, for I wanted to see him. I wanted to ask him to
      help me. I have never met him, or his daughter either; but my father and
      Mr. Prim have been friends for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Hettie Penning,&rdquo; she continued, addressing Jonas Prim. &ldquo;My father
      has always admired you and from what he has told me I knew that you would
      listen to me and do what you could for me. I could not bear to think of
      going to the jail in Payson, for Payson is my home. Everybody would have
      known me. It would have killed my father. Then I wanted to come myself and
      tell you, after reading the reports and insinuations in the paper, that
      your daughter was not with Reginald Paynter when he was killed. She had no
      knowledge of the crime and as far as I know may not have yet. I have not
      seen her and do not know where she is; but I was present when Mr. Paynter
      was killed. I have known him for years and have often driven with him. He
      stopped me yesterday afternoon on the street in Payson and talked with me.
      He was sitting in a car in front of the bank. After we had talked a few
      minutes two men came out of the bank. Mr. Paynter introduced them to me.
      He said they were driving out into the country to look at a piece of
      property&mdash;a farm somewhere north of Oakdale&mdash;and that on the way
      back they were going to stop at The Crossroads Inn for dinner. He asked me
      if I wouldn't like to come along&mdash;he kind of dared me to, because, as
      you know, The Crossroads has rather a bad reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father had gone to Toledo on business, and very foolishly I took his
      dare. Everything went all right until after we left The Inn, although one
      of the men&mdash;his companion referred to him once or twice as The
      Oskaloosa Kid&mdash;attempted to be too familiar with me. Mr. Paynter
      prevented him on each occasion, and they had words over me; but after we
      left the inn, where they had all drunk a great deal, this man renewed his
      attentions and Mr. Paynter struck him. Both of them were drunk. After that
      it all happened so quickly that I could scarcely follow it. The man called
      Oskaloosa Kid drew a revolver but did not fire, instead he seized Mr.
      Paynter by the coat and whirled him around and then he struck him an awful
      blow behind the ear with the butt of the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that the other two men seemed quite sobered. They discussed what
      would be the best thing to do and at last decided to throw Mr. Paynter's
      body out of the machine, for it was quite evident that he was dead. First
      they rifled his pockets, and joked as they did it, one of them saying that
      they weren't getting as much as they had planned on; but that a little was
      better than nothing. They took his watch, jewelry, and a large roll of
      bills. We passed around the east side of Oakdale and came back into the
      Toledo road. A little way out of town they turned the machine around and
      ran back for about half a mile; then they turned about a second time. I
      don't know why they did this. They threw the body out while the machine
      was moving rapidly; but I was so frightened that I can't say whether it
      was before or after they turned about the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In front of the old Squibbs place they shot at me and threw me out; but
      the bullet missed me. I have not seen them since and do not know where
      they went. I am ready and willing to aid in their conviction; but, please
      Mr. Prim, won't you keep me from being sent back to Payson or to jail. I
      have done nothing criminal and I won't run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the robbery of Miss Prim's room and the murder of Old Man
      Baggs?&rdquo; asked Burton. &ldquo;Did they pull both of those off before they killed
      Paynter or after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had nothing to do with either unless they did them after they threw
      me out of the car, which must have been long after midnight,&rdquo; replied the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the rest of the gang, those that were arrested with you,&rdquo; continued
      the detective, &ldquo;how about them? All angels, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was only Bridge and the boy they called The Oskaloosa Kid, though
      he isn't the same one that murdered poor Mr. Paynter, and the Gypsy girl,
      Giova, that were with me. The others were tramps who came into the old
      mill and attacked us while we were asleep. I don't know who they were. The
      girl could have had nothing to do with any of the crimes. We came upon her
      this morning burying her father in the woods back of the Squibbs' place.
      The man died of epilepsy last night. Bridge and the boy were taking refuge
      from the storm at the Squibbs place when I was thrown from the car. They
      heard the shot and came to my rescue. I am sure they had nothing to do
      with&mdash;with&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the truth,&rdquo; commanded Burton. &ldquo;It will go hard with you if you
      don't. What made you hesitate? You know something about those two&mdash;now
      out with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy robbed Mr. Prim's home&mdash;I saw some of the money and jewelry&mdash;but
      Bridge was not with him. They just happened to meet by accident during the
      storm and came to the Squibbs place together. They were kind to me, and I
      hate to tell anything that would get the boy in trouble. That is the
      reason I hesitated. He seemed such a nice boy! It is hard to believe that
      he is a criminal, and Bridge was always so considerate. He looks like a
      tramp; but he talks and acts like a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The telephone bell rang briskly, and a moment later the butler stepped
      into the room to say that Mr. Burton was wanted on the wire. He returned
      to the living room in two or three minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That clears up some of it,&rdquo; he said as he entered. &ldquo;The sheriff just had
      a message from the chief at Toledo saying that The Oskaloosa Kid is dying
      in a hospital there following an automobile accident. He knew he was done
      for and sent for the police. When they came he told them he had killed a
      man by the name of Paynter at Oakdale last night and the chief called up
      to ask what we knew about it. The Kid confessed to clear his pal who was
      only slightly injured in the smash-up. His story corroborates Miss
      Penning's in every detail, he also said that after killing Paynter he had
      shot a girl witness and thrown her from the car to prevent her squealing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once again the telephone bell rang, long and insistently. The butler
      almost ran into the room. &ldquo;Payson wants you, sir,&rdquo; he cried to Burton, &ldquo;in
      a hurry, sir, it's a matter of life and death, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burton sprang to the phone. When he left it he only stopped at the doorway
      of the living room long enough to call in: &ldquo;A mob has the two prisoners at
      Payson and are about to lynch them, and, my God, they're innocent. We all
      know now who killed Paynter and I have known since morning who murdered
      Baggs, and it wasn't either of those men; but they've found Miss Prim's
      jewelry on the fellow called Bridge and they've gone crazy&mdash;they say
      he murdered her and the young one did for Paynter. I'm going to Payson,&rdquo;
       and dashed from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; cried Jonas Prim, &ldquo;I'm going with you,&rdquo; and without waiting to
      find a hat he ran quickly after the detective. Once in the car he leaned
      forward urging the driver to greater speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God in heaven!&rdquo; he almost cried, &ldquo;the fools are going to kill the only
      man who can tell me anything about Abigail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      With oaths and threats the mob, brainless and heartless, cowardly,
      bestial, filled with the lust for blood, pushed and jammed into the narrow
      corridor before the cell door where the two prisoners awaited their fate.
      The single guard was brushed away. A dozen men wielding three railroad
      ties battered upon the grating of the door, swinging the ties far back and
      then in unison bringing them heavily forward against the puny iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge spoke to them once. &ldquo;What are you going to do with us?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're goin' to hang you higher 'n' Haman, you damned kidnappers an'
      murderers,&rdquo; yelled a man in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you give us a chance?&rdquo; asked Bridge in an even tone, unaltered
      by fear or excitement. &ldquo;You've nothing on us. As a matter of fact we are
      both innocent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shut your damned mouth,&rdquo; interrupted another of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge shrugged his shoulders and turned toward the youth who stood very
      white but very straight in a far corner of the cell. The man noticed the
      bulging pockets of the ill fitting coat; and, for the first time that
      night, his heart stood still in the face of fear; but not for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed to the youth's side and put his arm around the slender figure.
      &ldquo;There's no use arguing with them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They've made up their minds,
      or what they think are minds, that we're guilty; but principally they're
      out for a sensation. They want to see something die, and we're it. I doubt
      if anything could stop them now; they'd think we'd cheated them if we
      suddenly proved beyond doubt that we were innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy pressed close to the man. &ldquo;God help me to be brave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as
      brave as you are. We'll go together, Bridge, and on the other side you'll
      learn something that'll surprise you. I believe there is 'another side,'
      don't you, Bridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never thought much about it,&rdquo; said Bridge; &ldquo;but at a time like this
      I rather hope so&mdash;I'd like to come back and haunt this bunch of rat
      brained rubes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His arm slipped down the other's coat and his hand passed quickly behind
      the boy from one side to the other; then the door gave and the leaders of
      the mob were upon them. A gawky farmer seized the boy and struck him
      cruelly across the mouth. It was Jeb Case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You beast!&rdquo; cried Bridge. &ldquo;Can't you see that that&mdash;that's&mdash;only
      a child? If I don't live long enough to give you yours here, I'll come
      back and haunt you to your grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; ejaculated Jeb Case; but his sallow face turned white, and after
      that he was less rough with his prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two were dragged roughly from the jail. The great crowd which had now
      gathered fought to get a close view of them, to get hold of them, to
      strike them, to revile them; but the leaders kept the others back lest all
      be robbed of the treat which they had planned. Through town they haled
      them and out along the road toward Oakdale. There was some talk of taking
      them to the scene of Paynter's supposed murder; but wiser heads counselled
      against it lest the sheriff come with a posse of deputies and spoil their
      fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath a great tree they halted them, and two ropes were thrown over a
      stout branch. One of the leaders started to search them; and when he drew
      his hands out of Bridge's side pockets his eyes went wide, and he gave a
      cry of elation which drew excited inquiries from all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gum!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I reckon we ain't made no mistake here, boys. Look
      ahere!&rdquo; and he displayed two handsful of money and jewelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thet's Abbie Prim's stuff,&rdquo; cried one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy beside Bridge turned wide eyes upon the man. &ldquo;Where did you get
      it?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Oh, Bridge, why did you do it? Now they will kill you,&rdquo;
       and he turned to the crowd. &ldquo;Oh, please listen to me,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;He
      didn't steal those things. Nobody stole them. They are mine. They have
      always belonged to me. He took them out of my pocket at the jail because
      he thought that I had stolen them and he wanted to take the guilt upon
      himself; but they were not stolen, I tell you&mdash;they are mine! they
      are mine! they are mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another new expression came into Bridge's eyes as he listened to the boy's
      words; but he only shook his head. It was too late, and Bridge knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men were adjusting ropes about their necks. &ldquo;Before you hang us,&rdquo; said
      Bridge quietly, &ldquo;would you mind explaining just what we're being hanged
      for&mdash;it's sort of comforting to know, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thet's right,&rdquo; spoke up one of the crowd. &ldquo;Thet's fair. We want to do
      things fair and square. Tell 'em the charges, an' then ask 'em ef they got
      anything to say afore they're hung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This appealed to the crowd&mdash;the last statements of the doomed men
      might add another thrill to the evening's entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man who had searched them. &ldquo;There might o' been some
      doubts about you before, but they aint none now. You're bein' hung fer
      abductin' of an' most likely murderin' Miss Abigail Prim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy screamed and tried to interrupt; but Jeb Case placed a heavy and
      soiled hand over his mouth. The spokesman continued. &ldquo;This slicker
      admitted he was The Oskaloosa Kid, 'n' thet he robbed a house an' shot a
      man las' night; 'n' they ain't no tellin' what more he's ben up to. He
      tole Jeb Case's Willie 'bout it; an' bragged on it, by gum. 'Nenny way we
      know Paynter and Abigail Prim was last seed with this here Oskaloosa Kid,
      durn him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Bridge politely, &ldquo;and now may I make my final statement
      before going to meet my maker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; growled the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't interrupt me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! You damn fools have made up your minds to hang us. I doubt if
      anything I can say to you will alter your determination for the reason
      that if all the brains in this crowd were collected in one individual he
      still wouldn't have enough with which to weigh the most obvious evidence
      intelligently, but I shall present the evidence, and you can tell some
      intelligent people about it tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place it is impossible that I murdered Abigail Prim, and in
      the second place my companion is not The Oskaloosa Kid and was not with
      Mr. Paynter last night. The reason I could not have murdered Miss Prim is
      because Miss Prim is not dead. These jewels were not stolen from Miss
      Prim, she took them herself from her own home. This boy whom you are about
      to hang is not a boy at all&mdash;it is Miss Prim, herself. I guessed her
      secret a few minutes ago and was convinced when she cried that the jewels
      and money were her own. I don't know why she wishes to conceal her
      identity; but I can't stand by and see her lynched without trying to save
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd scoffed in incredulity. &ldquo;There are some women here,&rdquo; said
      Bridge. &ldquo;Turn her over to them. They'll tell you, at least that she is not
      a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some voices were raised in protest, saying that it was a ruse to escape,
      while others urged that the women take the youth. Jeb Case stepped toward
      the subject of dispute. &ldquo;I'll settle it durned quick,&rdquo; he announced and
      reached forth to seize the slim figure. With a sudden wrench Bridge tore
      himself loose from his captors and leaped toward the farmer, his right
      flew straight out from the shoulder and Jeb Case went down with a broken
      jaw. Almost simultaneously a car sped around a curve from the north and
      stopped suddenly in rear of the mob. Two men leaped out and shouldered
      their way through. One was the detective, Burton; the other was Jonas
      Prim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; cried the latter. &ldquo;God help you if you've killed either
      of them, for one of them must know what became of Abigail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed his way up until he faced the prisoners. The Oskaloosa Kid gave
      him a single look of surprise and then sprang toward him with outstretched
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, daddy, daddy!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don't let them kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd melted away from the immediate vicinity of the prisoners. None
      seemed anxious to appear in the forefront as a possible leader of a mob
      that had so nearly lynched the only daughter of Jonas Prim. Burton slipped
      the noose from about the girl's neck and then turned toward her companion.
      In the light from the automobile lamps the man's face was distinctly
      visible to the detective for the first time that night, and as Burton
      looked upon it he stepped back with an exclamation of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; he almost shouted. &ldquo;Gad, man! where have you been? Your father's
      spent twenty thousand dollars trying to find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge shook his head. &ldquo;I'm sorry, Dick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I'm afraid it's
      too late. The open road's gotten into my blood, and there's only one thing
      that&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo; he shook his head and smiled ruefully&mdash;&ldquo;but
      there ain't a chance.&rdquo; His eyes travelled to the slim figure sitting so
      straight in the rear seat of Jonas Prim's car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the little head turned in his direction. &ldquo;Hurry, Bridge,&rdquo;
       admonished The Oskaloosa Kid, &ldquo;you're coming home with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man stepped toward the car, shaking his head. &ldquo;Oh, no, Miss Prim,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I can't do that. Here's your 'swag.'&rdquo; And he smiled as he passed
      over her jewels and money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prim's eyes widened; he looked suspiciously at Bridge. Abigail laughed
      merrily. &ldquo;I stole them myself, Dad,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and then Mr. Bridge
      took them from me in the jail to make the mob think he had stolen them and
      not I&mdash;he didn't know then that I was a girl, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in the jail that I first guessed; but I didn't quite realize who
      you were until you said that the jewels were yours&mdash;then I knew. The
      picture in the paper gave me the first inkling that you were a girl, for
      you looked so much like the one of Miss Prim. Then I commenced to recall
      little things, until I wondered that I hadn't known from the first that
      you were a girl; but you made a bully boy!&rdquo; and they both laughed. &ldquo;And
      now good-by, and may God bless you!&rdquo; His voice trembled ever so little,
      and he extended his hand. The girl drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to come with us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want Father to know you and to
      know how you have cared for me. Won't you come&mdash;for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't refuse, if you put it that way,&rdquo; replied Bridge; and he
      climbed into the car. As the machine started off a boy leaped to the
      running-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he yelled, &ldquo;where's my reward? I want my reward. I'm Willie Case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Bridge. &ldquo;I gave your reward to your father&mdash;maybe
      he'll split it with you. Go ask him.&rdquo; And the car moved off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Burton, with a wry smile, &ldquo;how simple is the detective's
      job. Willie is a natural-born detective. He got everything wrong from A to
      Izzard, yet if it hadn't been for Willie we might not have cleared up the
      mystery so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't all cleared up yet,&rdquo; said Jonas Prim. &ldquo;Who murdered Baggs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two yeggs known as Dopey Charlie and the General,&rdquo; replied Burton. &ldquo;They
      are in the jail at Oakdale; but they don't know yet that I know they are
      guilty. They think they are being held merely as suspects in the case of
      your daughter's disappearance, whereas I have known since morning that
      they were implicated in the killing of Baggs; for after I got them in the
      car I went behind the bushes where we discovered them and dug up
      everything that was missing from Baggs' house, as nearly as is known&mdash;currency,
      gold and bonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Prim.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the trip back to Oakdale, Abigail Prim cuddled in the back seat beside
      her father, told him all that she could think to tell of Bridge and his
      goodness to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the man didn't know you were a girl,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Prim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were two other girls with us, both very pretty,&rdquo; replied Abigail,
      &ldquo;and he was as courteous and kindly to them as a man could be to a woman.
      I don't care anything about his clothes, Daddy; Bridge is a gentleman born
      and raised&mdash;anyone could tell it after half an hour with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bridge sat on the front seat with the driver and one of Burton's men,
      while Burton, sitting in the back seat next to the girl, could not but
      overhear her conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bridge, as you call him, is a gentleman. He
      comes of one of the finest families of Virginia and one of the wealthiest.
      You need have no hesitancy, Mr. Prim, in inviting him into your home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a while the three sat in silence; and then Jonas Prim turned to his
      daughter. &ldquo;Gail,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before we get home I wish you'd tell me why
      you did this thing. I think you'd rather tell me before we see Mrs. P.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Sam Benham, Daddy,&rdquo; whispered the girl. &ldquo;I couldn't marry him. I'd
      rather die, and so I ran away. I was going to be a tramp; but I had no
      idea a tramp's existence was so adventurous. You won't make me marry him,
      Daddy, will you? I wouldn't be happy, Daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not, Gail; you can be an old maid all your life if you want
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't want to&mdash;I only want to choose my own husband,&rdquo; replied
      Abigail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Prim met them all in the living-room. At sight of Abigail in the
      ill-fitting man's clothing she raised her hands in holy horror; but she
      couldn't see Bridge at all, until Burton found an opportunity to draw her
      to one side and whisper something in her ear, after which she was
      graciousness personified to the dusky Bridge, insisting that he spend a
      fortnight with them to recuperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between them, Burton and Jonas Prim fitted Bridge out as he had not been
      dressed in years, and with the feel of fresh linen and pressed clothing,
      even if ill fitting, a sensation of comfort and ease pervaded him which
      the man would not have thought possible from such a source an hour before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled ruefully as Burton looked him over. &ldquo;I venture to say,&rdquo; he
      drawled, &ldquo;that there are other things in the world besides the open road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burton smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight when the Prims and their guests arose from the table.
      Hettie Penning was with them, and everyone present had been sworn to
      secrecy about her share in the tragedy of the previous night. On the
      morrow she would return to Payson and no one there the wiser; but first
      she had Burton send to the jail for Giova, who was being held as a
      witness, and Giova promised to come and work for the Pennings.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Bridge stole a few minutes alone with Abigail, or, to be more
      strictly a truthful historian, Abigail outgeneraled the others of the
      company and drew Bridge out upon the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; demanded the girl, &ldquo;why you were so kind to me when you thought
      me a worthless little scamp of a boy who had robbed some one's home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't have told you a few hours ago,&rdquo; said Bridge. &ldquo;I used to wonder
      myself why I should feel toward a boy as I felt toward you,&mdash;it was
      inexplicable,&mdash;and then when I knew that you were a girl, I
      understood, for I knew that I loved you and had loved you from the moment
      that we met there in the dark and the rain beside the Road to Anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it wonderful?&rdquo; murmured the girl, and she had other things in her
      heart to murmur; but a man's lips smothered hers as Bridge gathered her
      into his arms and strained her to him.

Produced by Judith Boss, and David Widger

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
